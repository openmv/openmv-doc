.. method:: FT5X06.get_point_id(index)

   The touch point ``id`` is a numeric value that allows you to track a touch point as it may move
   around in list of touch points returned as points are added and removed.

   When a callback is enabled for the touch screen this method should not be called anymore except
   inside of the callback.

   This is the y pixel position of the touch point on the screen.

   When a callback is enabled for the touch screen this method should not be called anymore except
   inside of the callback.

.. method:: FT5X06.touch_callback(callback)

   This method registers a callback which will receive the number of touch
   points (0-5) when a touch event happens.

   If you use this method do not call `FT5X06.update_points()` anymore until the callback is
