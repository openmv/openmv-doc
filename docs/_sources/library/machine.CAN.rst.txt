class CAN -- controller area network communication bus
======================================================

**THIS MODULE EXISTS TO PROVIDE CAN SUPPORT FOR THE OPENMV CAM RT1062 AND WILL BE REMOVED
ONCE MICROPYTHON PROVIDES A STANDARD MACHINE CAN MODULE. THIS MODULE IS A COPY OF THE
PYB.CAN MODULE FOR THE STM32.**

CAN implements support for classic CAN controllers.
At the physical level CAN bus consists of 2 lines: RX and TX.  Note that to connect the board to a
CAN bus you must use a CAN transceiver to convert the CAN logic signals from the board to the correct
voltage levels on the bus.

Example usage for classic CAN controller in Loopback (transceiver-less) mode::

    from machine import CAN
    can = CAN(0, CAN.LOOPBACK)
    can.setfilter(0, CAN.DUAL, 0, (123, 124))  # set a filter to receive messages with id=123 and 124
    can.send('message!', 123)   # send a message with id 123
    can.recv(0)                 # receive message on FIFO 0

The following CAN module functions and their arguments are available
for classic CAN controllers, unless otherwise stated.

Constructors
------------

.. class:: CAN(bus, ...)

   Construct a CAN object on the given bus.  *bus* can be 0.
   With no additional parameters, the CAN object is created but not
   initialised (it has the settings from the last initialisation of
   the bus, if any).  If extra arguments are given, the bus is initialised.
   See :meth:`CAN.init` for parameters of initialisation.

   The physical pins of the CAN buses are:

     - ``CAN(0)``: ``(RX, TX) = (P3, P1)``

Methods
-------

.. method:: CAN.init(mode, *, auto_restart=False, baudrate=0)

   Initialise the CAN bus with the given parameters:

     - *mode* is one of:  NORMAL, LOOPBACK, SILENT, SILENT_LOOPBACK
     - *auto_restart* sets whether the controller will automatically try and restart
       communications after entering the bus-off state; if this is disabled then
       :meth:`~CAN.restart()` can be used to leave the bus-off state
     - *baudrate* sets the baudrate used to connect to the CAN bus

.. method:: CAN.deinit()

   Turn off the CAN bus.

.. method:: CAN.restart()

   Force a software restart of the CAN controller without resetting its
   configuration.

   If the controller enters the bus-off state then it will no longer participate
   in bus activity.  If the controller is not configured to automatically restart
   (see :meth:`~CAN.init()`) then this method can be used to trigger a restart,
   and the controller will follow the CAN protocol to leave the bus-off state and
   go into the error active state.

.. method:: CAN.state()

   Return the state of the controller.  The return value can be one of:

   - ``CAN.STOPPED`` -- the controller is completely off and reset;
   - ``CAN.ERROR_ACTIVE`` -- the controller is on and in the Error Active state
     (both TEC and REC are less than 96);
   - ``CAN.ERROR_WARNING`` -- the controller is on and in the Error Warning state
     (at least one of TEC or REC is 96 or greater);
   - ``CAN.ERROR_PASSIVE`` -- the controller is on and in the Error Passive state
     (at least one of TEC or REC is 128 or greater);
   - ``CAN.BUS_OFF`` -- the controller is on but not participating in bus activity
     (TEC overflowed beyond 255).

.. method:: CAN.info([list])

   Get information about the controller's error states and TX and RX buffers.
   If *list* is provided then it should be a list object with at least 8 entries,
   which will be filled in with the information.  Otherwise a new list will be
   created and filled in.  In both cases the return value of the method is the
   populated list.

   The values in the list are:

   - TEC value
   - REC value
   - number of times the controller enterted the Error Warning state (wrapped
     around to 0 after 65535)
   - number of times the controller enterted the Error Passive state (wrapped
     around to 0 after 65535)
   - number of times the controller enterted the Bus Off state (wrapped
     around to 0 after 65535)
   - number of pending TX messages
   - number of pending RX messages on fifo 0
   - always 0

.. method:: CAN.setfilter(bank, mode, fifo, params, *, rtr, extframe=False)

   Configure a filter bank:

   - *bank* is the classic CAN controller filter bank to configure.
   - *mode* is the mode the filter should operate in, see the tables below.
   - *fifo* is which fifo (0) a message should be stored in, if it is accepted by this filter.
   - *params* is an array of values the defines the filter. The contents of the array depends on the *mode* argument.

   +-----------+---------------------------------------------------------+
   |*mode*     |Contents of *params* array for classic CAN controller    |
   +===========+=========================================================+
   |CAN.LIST32 |Two 32 bit ids that will be accepted                     |
   +-----------+---------------------------------------------------------+
   |CAN.DUAL   |Two ids that will be accepted. For example (1, 2)        |
   +-----------+---------------------------------------------------------+

   - *rtr* For classic CAN controllers, this is an array of booleans that states if
     a filter should accept a remote transmission request message. If this argument
     is not given then it defaults to ``False`` for all entries. The length of the
     array depends on the *mode* argument.

   +-----------+----------------------+
   |*mode*     |length of *rtr* array |
   +===========+======================+
   |CAN.LIST32 |2                     |
   +-----------+----------------------+
   |CAN.DUAL   |2                     |
   +-----------+----------------------+

   - *extframe* If True the frame will have an extended identifier (29 bits),
     otherwise a standard identifier (11 bits) is used.


.. method:: CAN.clearfilter(bank, extframe=False)

   Clear and disables a filter bank:

   - *bank* is the classic CAN controller filter bank to clear.
   - *extframe* ignored

.. method:: CAN.any(fifo)

   Return ``True`` if any message waiting on the FIFO, else ``False``.

.. method:: CAN.recv(fifo, list=None, *, timeout=5000)

   Receive data on the bus:

     - *fifo* is an integer, which is the FIFO to receive on - always 0
     - *list* is an optional list object to be used as the return value
     - *timeout* is the timeout in milliseconds to wait for the receive.

   Return value: A tuple containing five values.

     - The id of the message.
     - A boolean that indicates if the message ID is standard or extended.
     - A boolean that indicates if the message is an RTR message.
     - The FMI (Filter Match Index) value.
     - An array containing the data.

   If *list* is ``None`` then a new tuple will be allocated, as well as a new
   bytes object to contain the data (as the fifth element in the tuple).

   If *list* is not ``None`` then it should be a list object with a least five
   elements.  The fifth element should be a memoryview object which is created
   from either a bytearray or an array of type 'B' or 'b', and this array must
   have enough room for at least 8 bytes.  The list object will then be
   populated with the first four return values above, and the memoryview object
   will be resized inplace to the size of the data and filled in with that data.
   The same list and memoryview objects can be reused in subsequent calls to
   this method, providing a way of receiving data without using the heap.
   For example::

        buf = bytearray(8)
        lst = [0, 0, 0, 0, memoryview(buf)]
        # No heap memory is allocated in the following call
        can.recv(0, lst)

.. method:: CAN.send(data, id, *, timeout=0, rtr=False, extframe=False)

   Send a message on the bus:

     - *data* is the data to send (an integer to send, or a buffer object).
     - *id* is the id of the message to be sent.
     - *timeout* is the timeout in milliseconds to wait for the send.
     - *rtr* is a boolean that specifies if the message shall be sent as
       a remote transmission request.  If *rtr* is True then only the length
       of *data* is used to fill in the DLC slot of the frame; the actual
       bytes in *data* are unused.
     - *extframe* if True the frame will have an extended identifier (29 bits),
       otherwise a standard identifier (11 bits) is used.

     If timeout is 0 the message is placed in a buffer and the method returns immediately.
	 If all three buffers are in use an exception is thrown. If timeout is not 0,
	 the method waits until the message is transmitted. If the message can't be transmitted
	 within the specified time an exception is thrown.

   Return value: ``None``.

.. method:: CAN.rxcallback(fifo, fun)

   Register a function to be called when a message is accepted into a empty fifo:

   - *fifo* is the receiving fifo - always 0.
   - *fun* is the function to be called when the fifo becomes non empty.

   The callback function takes two arguments the first is the can object it self the second is
   a integer that indicates the reason for the callback.

   +--------+------------------------------------------------+
   | Reason |                                                |
   +========+================================================+
   | 0      | A message has been accepted into a empty FIFO. |
   +--------+------------------------------------------------+
   | 1      | The FIFO is full                               |
   +--------+------------------------------------------------+
   | 2      | A message has been lost due to a full FIFO     |
   +--------+------------------------------------------------+

   Example use of rxcallback::

     def cb0(bus, reason):
       print('cb0')
       if reason == 0:
           print('pending')
       if reason == 1:
           print('full')
       if reason == 2:
           print('overflow')

     can = CAN(0, CAN.LOOPBACK)
     can.rxcallback(0, cb0)
