.. function:: load_decriptor(path)

   Loads a descriptor object from disk.

   ``path`` is the path to the descriptor file to load.

.. function:: save_descriptor(path, descriptor)

   Saves the descriptor object ``descriptor`` to disk.

   ``path`` is the path to the descriptor file to save.

.. function:: match_descriptor(descritor0, descriptor1, [threshold=70, [filter_outliers=False]])

   For LBP descriptors this function returns an integer representing the
   difference between the two descriptors. You may then threshold/compare this
   distance metric as necessary. The distance is a measure of similarity. The
   closer it is to zero the better the LBP keypoint match.

   For ORB descriptors this function returns the ``kptmatch`` object. See above.

   ``threshold`` is used for ORB keypoints to filter ambiguous matches. A lower
   ``threshold`` value tightens the keypoint matching algorithm. ``threshold``
   may be between 0-100 (int). Defaults to 70.

   ``filter_outliers`` is used for ORB keypoints to filter out outlier
   keypoints allow you to raise the ``threshold``. Defaults to False.

class HaarCascade -- Feature Descriptor
---------------------------------------

The Haar Cascade feature descriptor is used for the `Image.find_features()`
method. It doesn't have any methods itself for you to call.

.. class:: HaarCascade(path, [stages=Auto])

   Loads a Haar Cascade into memory from a Haar Cascade binary file formatted
   for your OpenMV Cam. If you pass "frontalface" instead of a path then this
   constructor will load the built-in frontal face Haar Cascade into memory.
   Additionally, you can also pass "eye" to load a Haar Cascade for eyes into
   memory. Finally, this method returns the loaded Haar Cascade object for use
   with `Image.find_features()`.

   ``stages`` defaults to the number of stages in the Haar Cascade. However,
   you can specify a lower number of stages to speed up processing the feature
   detector at the cost of a higher rate of false positives.

   .. note::
      You can make your own Haar Cascades to use with your OpenMV Cam.
      First, Google for "<thing> Haar Cascade" to see if someone
      already made an OpenCV Haar Cascade for an object you want to
      detect. If not... then you'll have to generate your own (which is
      a lot of work). See `here <http://coding-robin.de/2013/07/22/train-your-own-opencv-haar-classifier.html>`_
      for how to make your own Haar Cascade. Then see this `script <https://github.com/openmv/openmv/blob/master/usr/openmv-cascade.py>`_
      for converting OpenCV Haar Cascades into a format your OpenMV Cam
      can read.

   Q: What is a Haar Cascade?

   A: A Haar Cascade is a series of contrast checks that are used to determine
   if an object is present in the image. The contrast checks are split of into
   stages where a stage is only run if previous stages have already passed.
   The contrast checks are simple things like checking if the center vertical
   of the image is lighter than the edges. Large area checks are performed
   first in the earlier stages followed by more numerous and smaller area
   checks in later stages.

   Q: How are Haar Cascades made?

   A: Haar Cascades are made by training the generator algorithm against
   positive and negative labeled images. For example, you'd train the
   generator algorithm against hundreds of pictures with cats in them that
   have been labeled as images with cats and against hundreds of images with
   not cat like things labeled differently. The generator algorithm will then
   produce a Haar Cascade that detects cats.

class Histogram -- Histogram Object
-----------------------------------

The histogram object is returned by `Image.get_histogram()`.

Grayscale histograms have one channel with some number of bins. All bins are
normalized so that all bins sum to 1.

RGB565 histograms have three channels with some number of bins each. All bins
are normalized so that all bins in a channel sum to 1.

.. class:: histogram()

   Please call `Image.get_histogram()` to create this object.

   .. method:: bins()

      Returns a list of floats for the grayscale histogram.

      You may also get this value doing ``[0]`` on the object.

   .. method:: l_bins()

      Returns a list of floats for the RGB565 histogram LAB L channel.

      You may also get this value doing ``[0]`` on the object.

      You may also get this value doing ``[2]`` on the object.

   .. method:: get_percentile(percentile)

      Computes the CDF of the histogram channels and returns a `image.percentile`
      object with the values of the histogram at the passed in ``percentile`` (0.0
      - 1.0) (float). So, if you pass in 0.1 this method will tell you (going from
      left-to-right in the histogram) what bin when summed into an accumulator
      caused the accumulator to cross 0.1. This is useful to determine min (with
      0.1) and max (with 0.9) of a color distribution without outlier effects
      ruining your results for adaptive color tracking.

   .. method:: get_threshold()

      Uses Otsu's Method to compute the optimal threshold values that split the
      histogram into two halves for each channel of the histogram. This method
      returns a `image.threshold` object. This method is particularly useful for
      determining optimal `Image.binary()` thresholds.

   .. method:: get_statistics()

      Computes the mean, median, mode, standard deviation, min, max, lower
      quartile, and upper quartile of each color channel in the histogram and
      returns a `statistics` object.

      You may also use ``histogram.statistics()`` and ``histogram.get_stats()``
      as aliases for this method.

class Blob -- Blob object
-------------------------

The blob object is returned by `Image.find_blobs()`.

.. class:: blob()

   Please call `Image.find_blobs()` to create this object.

   .. method:: corners()

      Returns a list of 4 (x,y) tuples of the 4 corners of the object. Corners are
      always returned in sorted clock-wise order starting from the top left.

   .. method:: min_corners()

      Returns a list of 4 (x,y) tuples of the 4 corners than bound the min area
      rectangle of the blob. Unlike `blob.corners()` the min area rectangle corners
      do not necessarily lie on the blob.

   .. method:: rect()

      Returns a rectangle tuple (x, y, w, h) for use with other `image` methods
      like `Image.draw_rectangle()` of the blob's bounding box.

   .. method:: x()

      You may also get this value doing ``[1]`` on the object.

   .. method:: w()

      Returns the blob's bounding box w coordinate (int).

      You may also get this value doing ``[2]`` on the object.

   .. method:: h()

      You may also get this value doing ``[3]`` on the object.

   .. method:: pixels()

      You may also get this value doing ``[4]`` on the object.

   .. method:: cx()

      Returns the centroid x position of the blob (int).

   .. method:: cxf()

      Returns the centroid x position of the blob (float).

   .. method:: cy()

      Returns the centroid y position of the blob (int).

      You may also get this value doing ``[6]`` on the object.

   .. method:: cyf()

      Returns the centroid y position of the blob (float).

   .. method:: rotation()

      Returns the rotation of the blob in radians (float). If the blob is like
      a pencil or pen this value will be unique for 0-180 degrees. If the blob
      is round this value is not useful.

      You may also get this value doing ``[7]`` on the object.

   .. method:: rotation_deg()

      Returns the rotation of the blob in degrees.

   .. method:: rotation_rad()

      Returns the rotation of the blob in radians. This method is more descriptive
      than just `blob.rotation()`.

   .. method:: code()

      Returns a 32-bit binary number with a bit set in it for each color threshold
      that's part of this blob. For example, if you passed `Image.find_blobs()`
      three color thresholds to look for then bits 0/1/2 may be set for this blob.
      Note that only one bit will be set for each blob unless `Image.find_blobs()`
      was called with ``merge=True``. Then its possible for multiple blobs with
      different color thresholds to be merged together. You can use this method
      along with multiple thresholds to implement color code tracking.

      You may also get this value doing ``[8]`` on the object.

   .. method:: count()

      Returns the number of blobs merged into this blob. This is 1 unless you

   .. method:: perimeter()

      Returns the number of pixels on this blob's perimeter.

   .. method:: roundness()

      Returns a value between 0 and 1 representing how round the object is. A circle would be a 1.

   .. method:: elongation()

      Returns a value between 0 and 1 representing how long (not round) the object is. A line would be a 1.

   .. method:: area()

      Returns the area of the bounding box around the blob. (w * h).

   .. method:: density()

      Returns the density ratio of the blob. This is the number of pixels in the
      blob over its bounding box area. A low density ratio means in general that
      the lock on the object isn't very good. The result is between 0 and 1.

   .. method:: extent()

      Alias for `blob.density()`.

   .. method:: compactness()

      Like `blob.density()`, but, uses the perimeter of the blob instead to measure
      the objects density and is thus more accurate. The result is between 0 and 1.

   .. method:: solidity()

   Creates an ImageIO object.

   If ``path`` is a file name on disk then that file will be opened for reading if ``mode`` is ``'r'``
   or writing if ``mode`` is ``'w'``.

   ``path`` may also be a 3-value tuple (w, h, bpp) for in-memory storage of images. ``mode`` in
   this case is then the number of image buffers to store in memory. Note that the in-memory
   storage buffer is not allowed to grow in size after being allocated. Use a ``bpp`` value of
   0 for binary images, 1 for grayscale images, and 2 for rgb565 images.

   .. method:: type()

   .. method:: write(img)

      Writes a new image ``img`` to the ImageIO object. For on disk ImageIO objects the file will
      grow as new images are added. For in-memory ImageIO objects this just writes an image to the
      current pre-allocated slot before advancing to the next slot.

      Returns the ImageIO object.

   .. method:: read([copy_to_fb=False, [loop=True, [pause=True]]])

      Returns an image object from the ImageIO object. If ``copy_to_fb`` is False then
      the new image is allocated on the MicroPython heap. However, the MicroPython heap is limited
      and may not have space to store the new image if exhausted. Instead, set ``copy_to_fb`` to
      True to set the frame buffer to the new image making this function work just like `sensor.snapshot()`.

      ``loop`` if True automatically causes the ImageIO object to seek to the beginning at the end
      of the stream of images.

      ``pause`` if True causes this method to pause for a previously recorded number of milliseconds
      by write in-order to match the original frame rate that captured the image data.

   .. method:: seek(offset)

      Seeks to the image slot number ``offset`` in the ImageIO object.

      Works for on disk or in-memory objects.

   .. method:: sync()

      Writes out all data pending for on-disk ImageIO objects.

   .. method:: close()

      Closes the ImageIO object. For in-memory objects this free's the allocated space and for
      on-disk files this closes the file and writes out all meta-data.

   .. data:: FILE_STREAM

      ImageIO object was opened on a file.

   .. data:: MEMORY_STREAM

      iamgeIO object was opened in memory.

class Image -- Image object
---------------------------

The image object is the basic object for machine vision operations.

.. class:: Image(path, [buffer=None, [copy_to_fb=False]])

   Creates a new image object from a file at ``path``. Alternatively, you may
   pass a `width`, `height`, and either they any image format value like ``image.GRAYSCALE``
   to create new blank image object (initialized to 0 - black).

   Supports bmp/pgm/ppm/jpg/jpeg/png image files.

   ``copy_to_fb`` if True the image is loaded directly into the frame buffer
   allowing you to load up large images. If False, the image is loaded into
   MicroPython's heap which is much smaller than the frame buffer.

   ``buffer`` can be set to the any buffer object to use that as the data source
   for the image. For example, if you'd like to create a JPEG image from a JPEG
   ``bytes()`` or ``bytearray()`` object you can pass the ``width``, ``height``,
   ``image.JPEG`` for the JPEG along with setting ``buffer`` to the JPEG byte stream
   to create a JPEG image. Finally, note that images are buffer objects themselves.

   Images support "[]" notation. Do ``image[index] = 8/16-bit value`` to assign
   an image pixel or ``image[index]`` to get an image pixel which will be
   either an 8-bit value for grayscale/bayer images of a 16-bit value for RGB565/YUV
   images. Binary images return a 1-bit value.

   For JPEG images the "[]" allows you to access the compressed JPEG image blob
   as a byte-array. Reading and writing to the data array is opaque however as
   JPEG images are compressed byte streams.

   Images also support read buffer operations. You can pass images to all sorts
   of MicroPython functions like as if the image were a byte-array object. In
   particular, if you'd like to transmit an image you can just pass it to the
   UART/SPI/I2C write functions to be transmitted automatically.

   .. method:: width()

      Returns the image width in pixels.

   .. method:: height()

      Returns the image height in pixels.

   .. method:: format()

      Returns `image.GRAYSCALE` for grayscale images, `image.RGB565` for RGB565
      images, `image.BAYER` for bayer pattern images, and `image.JPEG` for JPEG
      images.

   .. method:: size()

      Returns the image size in bytes.

   .. method:: bytearray()

      Returns a `bytearray` object that points to the image data for byte-level read/write access.

      .. note::

         Image objects are automatically cast as `bytes` objects when passed to MicroPython driver
         that requires a `bytes` like object. This is read-only access.
         Call `bytearray()` to get read/write access.

   .. method:: get_pixel(x, y, [rgbtuple])

      For grayscale images: Returns the grayscale pixel value at location (x, y).
      For RGB565 images: Returns the RGB888 pixel tuple (r, g, b) at location (x, y).
      For bayer pattern images: Returns the the pixel value at the location (x, y).

      Returns None if ``x`` or ``y`` is outside of the image.

      ``x`` and ``y`` may either be passed independently or as a tuple.

      ``rgbtuple`` if True causes this method to return an RGB888 tuple. Otherwise,
      this method returns the integer value of the underlying pixel. I.e. for RGB565
      images this method returns a RGB565 value. Defaults to True
      for RGB565 images and False otherwise.

      Not supported on compressed images.

      .. note::

         `Image.get_pixel()` and `Image.set_pixel()` are the only methods that allow
         you to manipulate bayer pattern images. Bayer pattern images are literal images
         where pixels in the image are R/G/R/G/etc. for even rows and G/B/G/B/etc. for
         odd rows. Each pixel is 8-bits. If you call this method with ``rgbtuple`` set then `Image.get_pixel()`
         will debayer the source image at that pixel location and return a valid RGB888 tuple for the pixel location.

   .. method:: set_pixel(x, y, pixel)

      For grayscale images: Sets the pixel at location (x, y) to the grayscale value ``pixel``.
      For RGB565 images: Sets the pixel at location (x, y) to the RGB888 tuple (r, g, b) ``pixel``.
      For bayer pattern images: Sets the pixel value at the location (x, y) to the value ``pixel``.

      Returns the image object so you can call another method using ``.`` notation.

      ``x`` and ``y`` may either be passed independently or as a tuple.

      ``pixel`` may either be an RGB888 tuple (r, g, b) or the underlying pixel
      value (i.e. a RGB565 value for RGB565 images or an 8-bit value
      for grayscale images.

      Not supported on compressed images.

      .. note::

         `Image.get_pixel()` and `Image.set_pixel()` are the only methods that allow
         you to manipulate bayer pattern images. Bayer pattern images are literal images
         where pixels in the image are R/G/R/G/etc. for even rows and G/B/G/B/etc. for
         odd rows. Each pixel is 8-bits. If you call this method with an RGB888 tuple the grayscale
         value of that RGB888 tuple is extracted and set to the pixel location.

   .. method:: mean_pool(x_div, y_div)

      Finds the mean of ``x_div`` * ``y_div`` squares in the image and returns
      the modified image composed of the mean of each square.

      This method allows you to shrink an image down very quickly in-place.

      Not supported on compressed images or bayer images.

   .. method:: mean_pooled(x_div, y_div)

      Finds the mean of ``x_div`` * ``y_div`` squares in the image and returns
      a new image composed of the mean of each square.

      This method allows you to create a shrunken down image copy.

      Not supported on compressed images or bayer images.

   .. method:: midpoint_pool(x_div, y_div, [bias=0.5])

      Finds the midpoint of ``x_div`` * ``y_div`` squares in the image and returns
      the modified image composed of the midpoint of each square.

      A ``bias`` of 0.0 returns the min of each area while a ``bias`` of 1.0 returns
      the max of each area.

      This method allows you to shrink an image down very quickly in-place.

      Not supported on compressed images or bayer images.

   .. method:: midpoint_pooled(x_div, y_div, [bias=0.5])

      Finds the midpoint of ``x_div`` * ``y_div`` squares in the image and returns
      a new image composed of the midpoint of each square.

      A ``bias`` of 0.0 returns the min of each area while a ``bias`` of 1.0 returns
      the max of each area.

      This method allows you to create a shrunken down image copy.

      Not supported on compressed images or bayer images.

   .. method:: to_bitmap([x_scale=1.0, [y_scale=1.0, [roi=None, [rgb_channel=-1, [alpha=256, [color_palette=None, [alpha_palette=None, [hint=0, [copy=False]]]]]]]]])

      Converts an image to a bitmap image (1 bit per pixel). If ``copy`` is False
      this method will try to modify the image in-place. If ``copy`` is True then
      this method will return a new image copy allocated on the heap.

      ``copy`` may also be another image object, which in this case this method will try to
      re-use that image objects storage space and will return a new image object that uses
      the previous image objects storage space. After doing this do not use any references
      to the old image object anymore as they will be stale.

      ``x_scale`` controls how much the displayed image is scaled by in the x direction (float). If this
      value is negative the image will be flipped horizontally. Note that if ``y_scale`` is not specified
      then it will match ``x_scale`` to maintain the aspect ratio.

      ``y_scale`` controls how much the displayed image is scaled by in the y direction (float). If this
      value is negative the image will be flipped vertically. Note that if ``x_scale`` is not specified
      then it will match ``x_scale`` to maintain the aspect ratio.

      ``roi`` is the region-of-interest rectangle tuple (x, y, w, h) of the source image to draw. This
      allows you to extract just the pixels in the ROI to scale and draw on the destination image.

      ``rgb_channel`` is the RGB channel (0=R, G=1, B=2) to extract from an RGB565 image (if passed)
      and to render onto the destination image. For example, if you pass ``rgb_channel=1`` this will
      extract the green channel of the source RGB565 image and draw that in grayscale on the
      destination image.

      ``alpha`` controls how much of the source image to blend into the destination image. A value of
      256 draws an opaque source image while a value lower than 256 produces a blend between the source
      and destination image. 0 results in no modification to the destination image.

      ``color_palette`` if not ``-1`` can be `image.PALETTE_RAINBOW`, `image.PALETTE_IRONBOW`, or
      a 256 pixel in total RGB565 image to use as a color lookup table on the grayscale value of
      whatever the source image is. This is applied after ``rgb_channel`` extraction if used.

      ``alpha_palette`` if not ``-1`` can be a 256 pixel in total GRAYSCALE image to use as a alpha
      palette which modulates the ``alpha`` value of the source image being drawn at a pixel pixel
      level allowing you to precisely control the alpha value of pixels based on their grayscale value.
      A pixel value of 255 in the alpha lookup table is opaque which anything less than 255 becomes
      more transparent until 0. This is applied after ``rgb_channel`` extraction if used.

      ``hint`` can be a logical OR of the flags:

         * `image.AREA`: Use area scaling when downscaling versus the default of nearest neighbor.
         * `image.BILINEAR`: Use bilinear scaling versus the default of nearest neighbor scaling.
         * `image.BICUBIC`: Use bicubic scaling versus the default of nearest neighbor scaling.
         * `image.CENTER`: Center the image being drawn on the display. This is applied after scaling.
         * `image.HMIRROR`: Horizontally mirror the image.
         * `image.VFLIP`: Vertically flip the image.
         * `image.TRANSPOSE`: Transpose the image (swap x/y).
         * `image.EXTRACT_RGB_CHANNEL_FIRST`: Do rgb_channel extraction before scaling.
         * `image.APPLY_COLOR_PALETTE_FIRST`: Apply color palette before scaling.
         * `image.SCALE_ASPECT_KEEP`: Scale the image being drawn to fit inside the display.
         * `image.SCALE_ASPECT_EXPAND`: Scale the image being drawn to fill the display (results in cropping)
         * `image.SCALE_ASPECT_IGNORE`: Scale the image being drawn to fill the display (results in stretching).
         * `image.ROTATE_90`: Rotate the image by 90 degrees (this is just VFLIP | TRANSPOSE).
         * `image.ROTATE_180`: Rotate the image by 180 degrees (this is just HMIRROR | VFLIP).
         * `image.ROTATE_270`: Rotate the image by 270 degrees (this is just HMIRROR | TRANSPOSE).

      .. note::

         Bitmap images are like grayscale images with only two pixels values - 0
         and 1. Additionally, bitmap images are packed such that they only store
         1 bit per pixel making them very small. The OpenMV image library allows
         bitmap images to be used in all places `sensor.GRAYSCALE` and `sensor.RGB565` images
         can be used. However, many operations when applied on bitmap images don't
         make any sense becuase bitmap images only have 2 values. OpenMV recommends
         using bitmap images for ``mask`` values in operations and such as they
         fit on the MicroPython heap quite easily. Finally, bitmap image pixel values
         0 and 1 are interpreted as black and white when being applied to `sensor.GRAYSCALE`
         or `sensor.RGB565` images. The library automatically handles conversion.

      Returns the image object so you can call another method using ``.`` notation.

      Converts an image to an RGB565 ironbow image (16-bits per pixel). If ``copy`` is False
      this method will try to modify the image in-place. If ``copy`` is True then
      this method will return a new image copy allocated on the heap.

      ``copy`` may also be another image object, which in this case this method will try to
      re-use that image objects storage space and will return a new image object that uses
      the previous image objects storage space. After doing this do not use any references
      to the old image object anymore as they will be stale.

      ``x_scale`` controls how much the displayed image is scaled by in the x direction (float). If this
      value is negative the image will be flipped horizontally. Note that if ``y_scale`` is not specified
      then it will match ``x_scale`` to maintain the aspect ratio.

      ``y_scale`` controls how much the displayed image is scaled by in the y direction (float). If this
      value is negative the image will be flipped vertically. Note that if ``x_scale`` is not specified

      ``rgb_channel`` is the RGB channel (0=R, G=1, B=2) to extract from an RGB565 image (if passed)
      and to render onto the destination image. For example, if you pass ``rgb_channel=1`` this will
      extract the green channel of the source RGB565 image and draw that in grayscale on the
      destination image.

      ``alpha`` controls how much of the source image to blend into the destination image. A value of
      256 draws an opaque source image while a value lower than 256 produces a blend between the source
      and destination image. 0 results in no modification to the destination image.

      ``color_palette`` if not ``-1`` can be `image.PALETTE_RAINBOW`, `image.PALETTE_IRONBOW`, or

      palette which modulates the ``alpha`` value of the source image being drawn at a pixel pixel
      level allowing you to precisely control the alpha value of pixels based on their grayscale value.
      A pixel value of 255 in the alpha lookup table is opaque which anything less than 255 becomes
      more transparent until 0. This is applied after ``rgb_channel`` extraction if used.

      cost of destroying the original image.

      This method JPEG compresses the image and then formats the JPEG data for
      transmission to OpenMV IDE to display by encoding every 6-bits as a byte
      valued between 128-191. This is done to prevent JPEG data from being
      misinterpreted as other text data in the byte stream.

      You need to use this method to format image data for display to terminal
      windows created via "Open Terminal" in OpenMV IDE.

   .. method:: compressed([quality=90])

      Returns a JPEG compressed image - the original image is untouched. However,
      this method requires a somewhat large allocation of heap space so the image

      Creates a deep copy of the image object. If ``copy_to_fb`` is False then
      the new image is allocated on the MicroPython heap. However, the MicroPython heap is limited

         * `image.SCALE_ASPECT_IGNORE`: Scale the image being drawn to fill the display (results in stretching).
         * `image.ROTATE_90`: Rotate the image by 90 degrees (this is just VFLIP | TRANSPOSE).
         * `image.ROTATE_180`: Rotate the image by 180 degrees (this is just HMIRROR | VFLIP).

      Returns the image object so you can call another method using ``.`` notation.

      Not supported on compressed images.

   .. method:: scale([x_scale=1.0, [y_scale=1.0, [roi=None, [rgb_channel=-1, [alpha=256, [color_palette=None, [alpha_palette=None, [hint=0, [copy=False]]]]]]]]])

      Modifies an image in-place without changing the underlying image type. If ``copy`` is False
      this method will try to modify the image in-place. If ``copy`` is True then
      this method will return a new image copy allocated on the heap.

      ``copy`` may also be another image object, which in this case this method will try to
      re-use that image objects storage space and will return a new image object that uses
      the previous image objects storage space. After doing this do not use any references
      to the old image object anymore as they will be stale.

      ``x_scale`` controls how much the displayed image is scaled by in the x direction (float). If this
      value is negative the image will be flipped horizontally. Note that if ``y_scale`` is not specified
      then it will match ``x_scale`` to maintain the aspect ratio.

      ``y_scale`` controls how much the displayed image is scaled by in the y direction (float). If this
      value is negative the image will be flipped vertically. Note that if ``x_scale`` is not specified
      then it will match ``x_scale`` to maintain the aspect ratio.

      ``roi`` is the region-of-interest rectangle tuple (x, y, w, h) of the source image to draw. This
      allows you to extract just the pixels in the ROI to scale and draw on the destination image.

      ``rgb_channel`` is the RGB channel (0=R, G=1, B=2) to extract from an RGB565 image (if passed)
      and to render onto the destination image. For example, if you pass ``rgb_channel=1`` this will
      extract the green channel of the source RGB565 image and draw that in grayscale on the
      destination image.

      ``alpha`` controls how much of the source image to blend into the destination image. A value of
      256 draws an opaque source image while a value lower than 256 produces a blend between the source
      and destination image. 0 results in no modification to the destination image.

      ``color_palette`` if not ``-1`` can be `image.PALETTE_RAINBOW`, `image.PALETTE_IRONBOW`, or
      a 256 pixel in total RGB565 image to use as a color lookup table on the grayscale value of
      whatever the source image is. This is applied after ``rgb_channel`` extraction if used.

      ``alpha_palette`` if not ``-1`` can be a 256 pixel in total GRAYSCALE image to use as a alpha
      palette which modulates the ``alpha`` value of the source image being drawn at a pixel pixel
      level allowing you to precisely control the alpha value of pixels based on their grayscale value.
      A pixel value of 255 in the alpha lookup table is opaque which anything less than 255 becomes
      more transparent until 0. This is applied after ``rgb_channel`` extraction if used.

      ``hint`` can be a logical OR of the flags:

      white. However, you may also pass the underlying pixel value (0-255) for
      grayscale images or a RGB565 value for RGB565 images.

      ``scale`` may be increased to increase/decrease the size of the text on the
      image. You can pass greater than 0 integer or floating point values.

      ``x_spacing`` allows you to add (if positive) or subtract (if negative) x
      pixels between cahracters.

      ``y_spacing`` allows you to add (if positive) or subtract (if negative) y
      pixels between cahracters (for multi-line text).

      ``mono_space`` defaults to True which forces text to be fixed spaced. For
      large text scales this looks terrible. Set the False to get non-fixed width
      character spacing which looks A LOT better.

      ``char_rotation`` may be 0, 90, 180, 270 to rotate each character in the
      string by this amount.

      ``char_hmirror`` if True horizontally mirrors all characters in the string.

      white. However, you may also pass the underlying pixel value (0-255) for
      grayscale images or a RGB565 value for RGB565 images.

      ``size`` if greater than 0 causes the corners to be drawn as circles of radius ``size``.

      ``thickness`` controls how thick the line is in pixels.

      Pass ``fill`` set to True to fill the corner circles if drawn.

      Returns the image object so you can call another method using ``.`` notation.

      Draws an ``image`` whose top-left corner starts at location x, y. You may either pass x, y
      separately or as a tuple (x, y). This method automatically handles rendering the image passed
      into the correct pixel format for the destination image while also handling clipping seamlessly.

      You may also pass a path instead of an image object for this method to automatically load the image
      from disk and draw it in one step. E.g. ``draw_image("test.jpg")``.

      ``x_scale`` controls how much the displayed image is scaled by in the x direction (float). If this
      value is negative the image will be flipped horizontally. Note that if ``y_scale`` is not specified
      then it will match ``x_scale`` to maintain the aspect ratio.

      ``y_scale`` controls how much the displayed image is scaled by in the y direction (float). If this
      value is negative the image will be flipped vertically. Note that if ``x_scale`` is not specified
      then it will match ``x_scale`` to maintain the aspect ratio.

      and destination image. 0 results in no modification to the destination image.

      ``color_palette`` if not ``-1`` can be `image.PALETTE_RAINBOW`, `image.PALETTE_IRONBOW`, or
      a 256 pixel in total RGB565 image to use as a color lookup table on the grayscale value of
      whatever the source image is. This is applied after ``rgb_channel`` extraction if used.

      ``alpha_palette`` if not ``-1`` can be a 256 pixel in total GRAYSCALE image to use as a alpha
      palette which modulates the ``alpha`` value of the source image being drawn at a pixel pixel
      level allowing you to precisely control the alpha value of pixels based on their grayscale value.

   .. method:: draw_keypoints(keypoints, [color, [size=10, [thickness=1, [fill=False]]]])

      Draws the keypoints of a keypoints object on the image. You may also pass a
      list of three value tuples containing the (x, y, rotation_angle_in_degrees) to
      re-use this method for drawing keypoint glyphs which are a cirle with a line
      pointing in a particular direction.

      ``color`` is an RGB888 tuple for Grayscale or RGB565 images. Defaults to
      white. However, you may also pass the underlying pixel value (0-255) for
      grayscale images or a RGB565 value for RGB565 images.

      ``size`` controls how large the keypoints are.

      ``thickness`` controls how thick the line is in pixels.

      Pass ``fill`` set to True to fill the keypoints.

   .. method:: flood_fill(x, y, [seed_threshold=0.05, [floating_threshold=0.05, [color, [invert=False, [clear_background=False, [mask=None]]]]]])

      Flood fills a region of the image starting from location x, y. You may either
      pass x, y separately or as a tuple (x, y).

      ``seed_threshold`` controls how different any pixel in the fill area may be
      from the original starting pixel.

      ``floating_threshold`` controls how different any pixel in the fill area may
      be from any neighbor pixels.

      ``color`` is an RGB888 tuple for Grayscale or RGB565 images. Defaults to
      white. However, you may also pass the underlying pixel value (0-255) for
      grayscale images or a RGB565 value for RGB565 images.

      Pass ``invert`` as True to re-color everything outside of the flood-fill
      connected area.

      Pass ``clear_background`` as True to zero the rest of the pixels that
      flood-fill did not re-color.

      ``mask`` is another image to use as a pixel level mask for the operation.
      The mask should be an image with just black or white pixels and should be the
      same size as the image being operated on. Only pixels set in the mask are
      evaluated when flood filling.

      Returns the image object so you can call another method using ``.`` notation.

      Not supported on compressed images or bayer images.

      This method is not available on the OpenMV Cam M4.

      Not supported on compressed images or bayer images.

   .. method:: mask_ellipse([x, y, radius_x, radius_y, rotation_angle_in_degrees])

      Zeros an ellipsed shaped part of the image. If no arguments are supplied this
      method zeros the center of the image.

      Returns the image object so you can call another method using ``.`` notation.

      Not supported on compressed images or bayer images.

   .. method:: binary(thresholds, [invert=False, [zero=False, [mask=None, [to_bitmap=False, [copy=False]]]]])

      Sets all pixels in the image to black or white depending on if the pixel
      is inside of a threshold in the threshold list ``thresholds`` or not.

      ``thresholds`` must be a list of tuples ``[(lo, hi), (lo, hi), ..., (lo, hi)]``
      defining the ranges of color you want to track. For grayscale images each tuple
      needs to contain two values - a min grayscale value and a max grayscale value.
      Only pixel regions that fall between these thresholds will be considered.
      For RGB565 images each tuple needs to have six values (l_lo, l_hi, a_lo, a_hi, b_lo, b_hi)
      - which are minimums and maximums for the LAB L, A, and B channels respectively.
      For easy usage this function will automatically fix swapped min and max values.
      Additionally, if a tuple is larger than six values the rest are ignored.
      Conversely, if the tuple is too short the rest of the thresholds are assumed
      to be at maximum range.

      .. note::

         To get the thresholds for the object you want to track just select (click
         and drag) on the object you want to track in the IDE frame buffer. The
         histogram will then update to just be in that area. Then just write down
         where the color distribution starts and falls off in each histogram channel.
         These will be your low and high values for ``thresholds``. It's best to
         manually determine the thresholds versus using the upper and lower
         quartile statistics because they are too tight.

         You may also determine color thresholds by going into
         ``Tools->Machine Vision->Threshold Editor`` in OpenMV IDE and selecting
         thresholds from the GUI slider window.

      ``invert`` inverts the thresholding operation such that instead of matching
      pixels inside of some known color bounds pixels are matched that are outside
      of the known color bounds.

      Set ``zero`` to True to instead zero thresholded pixels and leave pixels
      not in the threshold list untouched.

      ``mask`` is another image to use as a pixel level mask for the operation.
      The mask should be an image with just black or white pixels and should be the
      same size as the image being operated on. Only pixels set in the mask are
      modified.

      ``to_bitmap`` turns the image data into a binary bitmap image where each
      pixel is stored in 1 bit. For very small images the new bitmap image may
      not fit inside of the original image requiring an out-of-place operation
      using ``copy``.

      ``copy`` if True creates a copy of the binarized image on the heap versus
      modifying the source image.

      .. note::

         Bitmap images are like grayscale images with only two pixels values - 0
         and 1. Additionally, bitmap images are packed such that they only store
         1 bit per pixel making them very small. The OpenMV image library allows
         bitmap images to be used in all places `sensor.GRAYSCALE` and `sensor.RGB565` images
         can be used. However, many operations when applied on bitmap images don't
         make any sense becuase bitmap images only have 2 values. OpenMV recommends
         using bitmap images for ``mask`` values in operations and such as they
         fit on the MicroPython heap quite easily. Finally, bitmap image pixel values
         0 and 1 are interpreted as black and white when being applied to `sensor.GRAYSCALE`
         or `sensor.RGB565` images. The library automatically handles conversion.

      Not supported on compressed images or bayer images.

   .. method:: erode(size, [threshold, [mask=None]])

      Removes pixels from the edges of segmented areas.

      This method works by convolving a kernel of ((size*2)+1)x((size*2)+1) pixels
      across the image and zeroing the center pixel of the kernel if the sum of
      the neighbour pixels set is not greater than ``threshold``.

      This method works like the standard erode method if threshold is not set. If
      ``threshold`` is set then you can specify erode to only erode pixels that

      ``mask`` is another image to use as a pixel level mask for the operation.
      The mask should be an image with just black or white pixels and should be the
      same size as the image being operated on. Only pixels set in the mask are

      modified.

      Not supported on compressed images or bayer images.

   .. method:: awb(max=False)

      Performs automatic white balance on the image using the gray-world algorithm. This method
      operates on RAW Bayer Images so that you can improve image quality before converting
      to RGB565 or passing the RAW Bayer Image to an image processing funciton. You may also
      call this on a RGB565. This method has no affect on binary/grayscale images.

      ``max`` if True uses the white-patch algorithm instead.

      Returns the image object so you can call another method using ``.`` notation.

      Not supported on compressed images.

   .. method:: ccm(matrix)

      Multiples the passed (3x3) or (4x3) floating-point color-correction-matrix with the image.

      For example, if you pass a 3x3 matrix the method will do this to every pixel the image::

             1x3         1x4         4x3 
          [R, G, B] = [r, g, b][1, 0, 0,
                                0, 1, 0,
                                0, 0, 1]

      Note that the sum of each column in the 3x3 matrix should generally be 1. Weights may either
      be positive or negative but, again, should generally sum to 1 per column.

      If you pass a 4x3 matrix the method will do this to every pixel the image::

             1x3         1x4         4x3 
          [R, G, B] = [r, g, b, 1][1, 0, 0,
                                   0, 1, 0,
                                   0, 0, 1,
                                   0, 0, 0]

      Where the last row of the 4x3 matrix is an offset per color channel. If you add an offset
      you may wish to make the weights sum to less than 1 to account for the offset.

      You want to use this method to eliminate systemic cross talk between color channels.
      However, this should generally be never.

      Returns the image object so you can call another method using ``.`` notation.

      Not supported on compressed images or bayer images.

   .. method:: gamma([gamma=1.0, [contrast=1.0, [brightness=0.0])

      Quickly changes the image gamma, contrast, and brightness. Please use this
      method instead of `Image.mul` or `Image.div` which are meant for blending to
      adjust pixels values.

      ``gamma`` with values greater than 1.0 makes the image darker in a non-linear
      manner while less than 1.0 makes the image brighter. The gamma value is applied
      to the image by scaling all pixel color channels to be between [0:1) and then
      doing a remapping of ``pow(pixel, 1/gamma)`` on all pixels before scaling back.

      ``contrast`` with values greater than 1.0 makes the image brighter in a linear
      manner while less than 1.0 makes the image darker. The contrast value is applied
      to the image by scaling all pixel color channels to be between [0:1) and then
      doing a remapping of ``pixel * contrast`` on all pixels before scaling back.

      ``brightness`` with values greater than 0.0 makes the image brighter in a constant
      manner while less than 0.0 makes the image darker. The brightness value is applied
      to the image by scaling all pixel color channels to be between [0:1) and then
      doing a remapping of ``pixel + brightness`` on all pixels before scaling back.

      Returns the image object so you can call another method using ``.`` notation.

      Not supported on compressed images.

   .. method:: gamma_corr([gamma=1.0, [contrast=1.0, [brightness=0.0])

      Alias for `Image.gamma`.

   .. method:: negate()

      Flips (numerically inverts) all pixels values in an image very quickly. E.g.
      for GRAYSCALE images this method changes all pixels from ``pixel`` to ``255 - pixel``.

      Returns the image object so you can call another method using ``.`` notation.

      Not supported on compressed images or bayer images.

   .. method:: replace(image, [hmirror=False, [vflip=False, [transpose=False, [mask=None]]]])

      Replaces all pixels in the image object with a new image.

      ``image`` can either be another image object, a path to an uncompressed image
      file (bmp/pgm/ppm), or a scalar value. If a scalar value the value can
      either be an RGB888 tuple or the underlying pixel value (e.g. an 8-bit grayscale
      for grayscale images or a RGB565 value for RGB images).

      Set ``hmirror`` to True to horizontally mirror the replacing image.

      Set ``vflip`` to True to vertically flip the replacing image.

      Set ``transpose`` to True to flip the image along the diagonal (this changes
      the image image width/height if the image is non-square).

      If you want to rotate an image by multiples of 90 degrees pass the following:

         * vflip=False, hmirror=False, transpose=False -> 0 degree rotation
         * vflip=True,  hmirror=False, transpose=True  -> 90 degree rotation
         * vflip=True,  hmirror=True,  transpose=False -> 180 degree rotation
         * vflip=False, hmirror=True,  transpose=True  -> 270 degree rotation

      .. note::

         If you don't pass an ``image`` this method will operate on the underlying
         image that you were going to replace by applying the ``hmirror``, ``vflip``,
         and ``transpose`` options to rotate the image around. E.g. if you want
         to do ``img.replace(img, etc...)`` you just need to do ``img.replace(etc..)``.

      ``mask`` is another image to use as a pixel level mask for the operation.
      The mask should be an image with just black or white pixels and should be the
      same size as the image being operated on. Only pixels set in the mask are
      modified. Note that the mask is applied on the image before hmirror/vflip/transpose
      so the mask should be the same width/height of the initial unmodifed image.

      Returns the image object so you can call another method using ``.`` notation.

      Not supported on compressed images or bayer images.

   .. method:: assign(image, [hmirror=False, [vflip=False, [transpose=False, [mask=None]]]])

      for grayscale images or a RGB565 value for RGB images).

      ``mask`` is another image to use as a pixel level mask for the operation.
      The mask should be an image with just black or white pixels and should be the

      file (bmp/pgm/ppm), or a scalar value. If a scalar value the value can
      either be an RGB888 tuple or the underlying pixel value (e.g. an 8-bit grayscale
      for grayscale images or a RGB565 value for RGB images).

      Set ``reverse`` to True to reverse the subtraction operation from
      ``this_image-image`` to ``image-this_image``.

      ``mask`` is another image to use as a pixel level mask for the operation.
      The mask should be an image with just black or white pixels and should be the
      same size as the image being operated on. Only pixels set in the mask are
      modified.

      Returns the image object so you can call another method using ``.`` notation.

      Not supported on compressed images or bayer images.

      ``image`` can either be an image object, a path to an uncompressed image
      file (bmp/pgm/ppm), or a scalar value. If a scalar value the value can
      either be an RGB888 tuple or the underlying pixel value (e.g. an 8-bit grayscale
      for grayscale images or a RGB565 value for RGB images).

      Set ``invert`` to True to change the multiplication operation from ``a*b``
      to ``1/((1/a)*(1/b))``. In particular, this lightens the image instead of
      darkening it (e.g. multiply versus burn operations).

      ``mask`` is another image to use as a pixel level mask for the operation.
      The mask should be an image with just black or white pixels and should be the
      same size as the image being operated on. Only pixels set in the mask are
      modified.

      Returns the image object so you can call another method using ``.`` notation.

      Not supported on compressed images or bayer images.

      .. note::

         This method is meant for image blending and cannot multiply the pixels in
         the image by a scalar like ``2``. Use `Image.gamma_corr` for that.

   .. method:: div(image, [invert=False, [mod=False, [mask=None]]])

      Divides this image by another one.

      ``image`` can either be an image object, a path to an uncompressed image
      file (bmp/pgm/ppm), or a scalar value. If a scalar value the value can
      either be an RGB888 tuple or the underlying pixel value (e.g. an 8-bit grayscale
      for grayscale images or a RGB565 value for RGB images).

      Set ``invert`` to True to change the division direction from ``a/b`` to
      ``b/a``.

      Set ``mod`` to True to change the division operation to the modulus operation.

      ``mask`` is another image to use as a pixel level mask for the operation.

      ``image`` can either be an image object, a path to an uncompressed image
      file (bmp/pgm/ppm), or a scalar value. If a scalar value the value can

      Alpha blends two images with each other.

      ``image`` can either be an image object, a path to an uncompressed image
      file (bmp/pgm/ppm), or a scalar value. If a scalar value the value can
      either be an RGB888 tuple or the underlying pixel value (e.g. an 8-bit grayscale
      for grayscale images or a RGB565 value for RGB images).

      ``alpha`` controls how much of the other image to blend into this image.
      ``alpha`` should be an integer value between 0 and 256. A value closer to
      zero blends more of the other image into this image and a value closer to
      256 does the opposite.

      ``mask`` is another image to use as a pixel level mask for the operation.
      The mask should be an image with just black or white pixels and should be the
      same size as the image being operated on. Only pixels set in the mask are

      Not supported on compressed images or bayer images.

   .. method:: histeq([adaptive=False, [clip_limit=-1, [mask=None]]])

      Runs the histogram equalization algorithm on the image. Histogram
      equalization normalizes the contrast and brightness in the image.

      If you pass ``adaptive`` as True then an adaptive histogram equalization
      method will be run on the image instead which as generally better results
      than non-adaptive histogram qualization but a longer run time.

      ``clip_limit`` provides a way to limit the contrast of the adaptive histogram
      qualization. Use a small value for this, like 10, to produce good histogram
      equalized contrast limited images.

      ``mask`` is another image to use as a pixel level mask for the operation.
      The mask should be an image with just black or white pixels and should be the
      same size as the image being operated on. Only pixels set in the mask are

      Standard mean blurring filter using a box filter.

      ``size`` is the kernel size. Use 1 (3x3 kernel), 2 (5x5 kernel), etc.

      If you'd like to adaptive threshold the image on the output of the filter
      you can pass ``threshold=True`` which will enable adaptive thresholding of the
      image which sets pixels to one or zero based on a pixel's brightness in relation
      to the brightness of the kernel of pixels around them. A negative ``offset``
      value sets more pixels to 1 as you make it more negative while a positive
      value only sets the sharpest contrast changes to 1. Set ``invert`` to invert
      the binary image resulting output.

      ``mask`` is another image to use as a pixel level mask for the operation.
      The mask should be an image with just black or white pixels and should be the
      same size as the image being operated on. Only pixels set in the mask are
      modified.

      Returns the image object so you can call another method using ``.`` notation.

      Not supported on compressed images or bayer images.

      This method is not available on the OpenMV Cam M4.

   .. method:: median(size, [percentile=0.5, [threshold=False, [offset=0, [invert=False, [mask=None]]]]])

      Runs the median filter on the image. The median filter is the best filter
      for smoothing surfaces while preserving edges but it is very slow.

      ``size`` is the kernel size. Use 1 (3x3 kernel), 2 (5x5 kernel), etc.

      ``percentile`` controls the percentile of the value used in the kernel. By
      default each pixel is replaced with the 50th percentile (center) of its
      neighbors. You can set this to 0 for a min filter, 0.25 for a lower quartile
      filter, 0.75 for an upper quartile filter, and 1.0 for a max filter.

      If you'd like to adaptive threshold the image on the output of the filter
      you can pass ``threshold=True`` which will enable adaptive thresholding of the
      image which sets pixels to one or zero based on a pixel's brightness in relation
      to the brightness of the kernel of pixels around them. A negative ``offset``
      value sets more pixels to 1 as you make it more negative while a positive
      value only sets the sharpest contrast changes to 1. Set ``invert`` to invert
      the binary image resulting output.

      ``mask`` is another image to use as a pixel level mask for the operation.
      The mask should be an image with just black or white pixels and should be the
      same size as the image being operated on. Only pixels set in the mask are
      modified.

      Returns the image object so you can call another method using ``.`` notation.

      Not supported on compressed images or bayer images.

      This method is not available on the OpenMV Cam M4.

   .. method:: mode(size, [threshold=False, [offset=0, [invert=False, [mask=None]]]]])

      Runs the mode filter on the image by replacing each pixel with the mode of
      their neighbors. This method works great on grayscale images. However, on
      RGB images it creates a lot of artifacts on edges because of the non-linear
      nature of the operation.

      ``size`` is the kernel size. Use 1 (3x3 kernel), 2 (5x5 kernel), etc.

      If you'd like to adaptive threshold the image on the output of the filter
      you can pass ``threshold=True`` which will enable adaptive thresholding of the
      image which sets pixels to one or zero based on a pixel's brightness in relation
      to the brightness of the kernel of pixels around them. A negative ``offset``
      value sets more pixels to 1 as you make it more negative while a positive
      value only sets the sharpest contrast changes to 1. Set ``invert`` to invert
      the binary image resulting output.

      ``mask`` is another image to use as a pixel level mask for the operation.
      The mask should be an image with just black or white pixels and should be the
      same size as the image being operated on. Only pixels set in the mask are
      modified.

      Returns the image object so you can call another method using ``.`` notation.

      Not supported on compressed images or bayer images.

      This method is not available on the OpenMV Cam M4.

   .. method:: midpoint(size, [bias=0.5, [threshold=False, [offset=0, [invert=False, [mask=None]]]]])

      Runs the midpoint filter on the image. This filter finds the midpoint
      ((max-min)/2) of each pixel neighborhood in the image.

      ``size`` is the kernel size. Use 1 (3x3 kernel), 2 (5x5 kernel), etc.

      ``bias`` controls the min/max mixing. 0 for min filtering only, 1.0 for max
      filtering only. By using the ``bias`` you can min/max filter the image.

      If you'd like to adaptive threshold the image on the output of the filter
      you can pass ``threshold=True`` which will enable adaptive thresholding of the
      image which sets pixels to one or zero based on a pixel's brightness in relation
      to the brightness of the kernel of pixels around them. A negative ``offset``
      value sets more pixels to 1 as you make it more negative while a positive
      value only sets the sharpest contrast changes to 1. Set ``invert`` to invert
      the binary image resulting output.

      ``mask`` is another image to use as a pixel level mask for the operation.
      The mask should be an image with just black or white pixels and should be the

      This method is not available on the OpenMV Cam M4.

   .. method:: morph(size, kernel, [mul, [add=0, [threshold=False, [offset=0, [invert=False, [mask=None]]]]]])

      Convolves the image by a filter kernel. This allows you to do general purpose
      convolutions on an image.

      ``size`` controls the size of the kernel which must be
      ((size*2)+1)x((size*2)+1) elements big.

      ``kernel`` is the kernel to convolve the image by. It can either be a tuple
      or a list of integer values.

      ``mul`` is number to multiply the convolution pixel results by. When not set
      it defaults to a value that will prevent scaling in the convolution output.

      ``add`` is a value to add to each convolution pixel result.

      ``mul`` basically allows you to do a global contrast adjustment and ``add``
      allows you to do a global brightness adjustment. Pixels that go outside of
      the image mins and maxes for color channels will be clipped.

      If you'd like to adaptive threshold the image on the output of the filter
      you can pass ``threshold=True`` which will enable adaptive thresholding of the
      image which sets pixels to one or zero based on a pixel's brightness in relation
      to the brightness of the kernel of pixels around them. A negative ``offset``
      value sets more pixels to 1 as you make it more negative while a positive
      value only sets the sharpest contrast changes to 1. Set ``invert`` to invert
      the binary image resulting output.

      ``mask`` is another image to use as a pixel level mask for the operation.
      The mask should be an image with just black or white pixels and should be the
      same size as the image being operated on. Only pixels set in the mask are
      modified.

      Returns the image object so you can call another method using ``.`` notation.

      Not supported on compressed images or bayer images.

   .. method:: gaussian(size, [unsharp=False, [mul, [add=0, [threshold=False, [offset=0, [invert=False, [mask=None]]]]]]])

      Convolves the image by a smoothing guassian kernel.

      ``size`` is the kernel size. Use 1 (3x3 kernel), 2 (5x5 kernel), etc.

      If ``unsharp`` is set to the True then instead of doing just a guassian
      filtering operation this method will perform an unsharp mask operation which
      improves image sharpness on edges.

      ``mul`` is number to multiply the convolution pixel results by. When not set
      it defaults to a value that will prevent scaling in the convolution output.

      ``add`` is a value to add to each convolution pixel result.

      ``mul`` basically allows you to do a global contrast adjustment and ``add``
      allows you to do a global brightness adjustment. Pixels that go outside of
      the image mins and maxes for color channels will be clipped.

      If you'd like to adaptive threshold the image on the output of the filter
      you can pass ``threshold=True`` which will enable adaptive thresholding of the
      image which sets pixels to one or zero based on a pixel's brightness in relation
      to the brightness of the kernel of pixels around them. A negative ``offset``
      value sets more pixels to 1 as you make it more negative while a positive
      value only sets the sharpest contrast changes to 1. Set ``invert`` to invert
      the binary image resulting output.

      ``mask`` is another image to use as a pixel level mask for the operation.
      The mask should be an image with just black or white pixels and should be the
      same size as the image being operated on. Only pixels set in the mask are
      modified.

      Returns the image object so you can call another method using ``.`` notation.

      Not supported on compressed images or bayer images.

   .. method:: laplacian(size, [sharpen=False, [mul, [add=0, [threshold=False, [offset=0, [invert=False, [mask=None]]]]]]])

      Convolves the image by a edge detecting laplacian kernel.

      ``size`` is the kernel size. Use 1 (3x3 kernel), 2 (5x5 kernel), etc.

      If ``sharpen`` is set to the True then instead of just outputting an
      unthresholded edge detection image this method will instead sharpen the
      image. Increase the kernel size then to increase the image sharpness.

      ``mul`` is number to multiply the convolution pixel results by. When not set
      it defaults to a value that will prevent scaling in the convolution output.

      ``add`` is a value to add to each convolution pixel result.

      ``mul`` basically allows you to do a global contrast adjustment and ``add``
      allows you to do a global brightness adjustment. Pixels that go outside of
      the image mins and maxes for color channels will be clipped.

      you can pass ``threshold=True`` which will enable adaptive thresholding of the
      image which sets pixels to one or zero based on a pixel's brightness in relation
      to the brightness of the kernel of pixels around them. A negative ``offset``
      value sets more pixels to 1 as you make it more negative while a positive
      value only sets the sharpest contrast changes to 1. Set ``invert`` to invert
      the binary image resulting output.

      ``mask`` is another image to use as a pixel level mask for the operation.
      The mask should be an image with just black or white pixels and should be the
      same size as the image being operated on. Only pixels set in the mask are
      modified.

      Returns the image object so you can call another method using ``.`` notation.

      Not supported on compressed images or bayer images.

      This method is not available on the OpenMV Cam M4.

   .. method:: bilateral(size, [color_sigma=0.1, [space_sigma=1, [threshold=False, [offset=0, [invert=False, [mask=None]]]]]])

      Convolves the image by a bilateral filter. The bilateral filter smooths the
      image while keeping edges in the image.

      ``size`` is the kernel size. Use 1 (3x3 kernel), 2 (5x5 kernel), etc.

      ``color_sigma`` controls how closely colors are matched using the bilateral
      filter. Increase this to increase color blurring.

      ``space_sigma`` controls how closely pixels space-wise are blurred with
      each other. Increase this to increase pixel blurring.

      If you'd like to adaptive threshold the image on the output of the filter
      you can pass ``threshold=True`` which will enable adaptive thresholding of the
      image which sets pixels to one or zero based on a pixel's brightness in relation
      to the brightness of the kernel of pixels around them. A negative ``offset``
      value sets more pixels to 1 as you make it more negative while a positive
      value only sets the sharpest contrast changes to 1. Set ``invert`` to invert

      Not supported on compressed images or bayer images.

      This method is not available on the OpenMV Cam M4.

   .. method:: linpolar([reverse=False])

      Re-project's and image from cartessian coordinates to linear polar coordinates.

      Set ``reverse=True`` to re-project in the opposite direction.

      Linear polar re-projection turns rotation of an image into x-translation.

      Not supported on compressed images or bayer images.

      This method is not available on the OpenMV Cam M4.

   .. method:: logpolar([reverse=False])

      Re-project's and image from cartessian coordinates to log polar coordinates.

      Set ``reverse=True`` to re-project in the opposite direction.

      Log polar re-projection turns rotation of an image into x-translation
      and scaling/zooming into y-translation.

      Not supported on compressed images or bayer images.

      This method is not available on the OpenMV Cam M4.

   .. method:: lens_corr([strength=1.8, [zoom=1.0, [x_corr=0.0, [y_corr=0.0]]]])

      Performs lens correction to un-fisheye the image due to the lens distortion.

      ``strength`` is a float defining how much to un-fisheye the image. Try 1.8
      out by default and then increase or decrease from there until the image
      looks good.

      ``zoom`` is the amount to zoom in on the image by. 1.0 by default.

      ``x_corr`` floating point pixel offset from center. Can be negative or positive.

      ``y_corr`` floating point pixel offset from center. Can be negative or positive.

      Returns the image object so you can call another method using ``.`` notation.

      Not supported on compressed images or bayer images.

   .. method:: img.rotation_corr([x_rotation=0.0, [y_rotation=0.0, [z_rotation=0.0, [x_translation=0.0, [y_translation=0.0, [zoom=1.0, [fov=60.0, [corners]]]]]]]])

      Corrects perspective issues in the image by doing a 3D rotation of the frame buffer.

      ``x_rotation`` is the number of degrees to rotation the image in the frame buffer
      around the x axis (i.e. this spins the image up and down).

      ``y_rotation`` is the number of degrees to rotation the image in the frame buffer
      around the y axis (i.e. this spins the image left and right).

      ``z_rotation`` is the number of degrees to rotation the image in the frame buffer
      around the z axis (i.e. this spins the image in place).

      ``x_translation`` is the number of units to move the image to the left or right
      after rotation. Because this translation is applied in 3D space the units aren't pixels...

      ``y_translation`` is the number of units to move the image to the up or down
      after rotation. Because this translation is applied in 3D space the units aren't pixels...

      ``zoom`` is the amount to zoom in on the image by. 1.0 by default.

      ``fov`` is the field-of-view to use internally when doing 2D->3D projection before
      rotating the image in 3D space. As this value approaches 0 the image is placed at infinity away
      from the viewport. As this value approaches 180 the image is placed within the viewport. Typically,
      you should not change this value but you can modify it to change the 2D->3D mapping effect.

      ``corners`` is a list of four (x,y) tuples representing four corners used to create a 4-point
      correspondence homography that will map the first corner to (0, 0), the second corner to
      (image_width-1, 0), the third corner to (image_width-1, image_height-1), and the fourth corner
      to (0, image_height-1). The 3D rotation is then applied after the image is re-mapped. This
      argument lets you use `rotation_corr` to do things like birds-eye-view transforms. E.g::

          top_tilt = 10 # if the difference between top/bottom_tilt become to large this method will stop working
          bottom_tilt = 0

          points = [(tilt, 0), (img.width()-tilt, 0), (img.width()-1-bottom_tilt, img.height()-1), (bottom_tilt, img.height()-1)]

          img.rotation_corr(corners=points)

      Returns the image object so you can call another method using ``.`` notation.

      Not supported on compressed images or bayer images.

      This method is not available on the OpenMV Cam M4.

   .. method:: get_histogram([thresholds, [invert=False, [roi, [bins, [l_bins, [a_bins, [b_bins, [difference]]]]]]]])

      Computes the normalized histogram on all color channels for an ``roi`` and
      returns a `image.histogram` object. Please see the `image.histogram` object for more
      information. You can also invoke this method by using ``Image.get_hist()`` or
      ``Image.histogram()``. If you pass a list of ``thresholds`` then the histogram
      information will only be computed from pixels within the threshold list.

      ``thresholds`` must be a list of tuples
      ``[(lo, hi), (lo, hi), ..., (lo, hi)]`` defining the ranges of color you
      want to track. For
      grayscale images each tuple needs to contain two values - a min grayscale
      value and a max grayscale value. Only pixel regions that fall between these
      thresholds will be considered. For RGB565 images each tuple needs to have
      six values (l_lo, l_hi, a_lo, a_hi, b_lo, b_hi) - which are minimums and
      maximums for the LAB L, A, and B channels respectively. For easy usage this
      function will automatically fix swapped min and max values. Additionally,
      if a tuple is larger than six values the rest are ignored. Conversely, if the
      tuple is too short the rest of the thresholds are assumed to be at maximum
      range.

      .. note::

         To get the thresholds for the object you want to track just select (click
         and drag) on the object you want to track in the IDE frame buffer. The
         histogram will then update to just be in that area. Then just write down
         where the color distribution starts and falls off in each histogram channel.
         These will be your low and high values for ``thresholds``. It's best to
         manually determine the thresholds versus using the upper and lower
         quartile statistics because they are too tight.

         You may also determine color thresholds by going into
         ``Tools->Machine Vision->Threshold Editor`` in OpenMV IDE and selecting
         thresholds from the GUI slider window.

      ``invert`` inverts the thresholding operation such that instead of matching
      pixels inside of some known color bounds pixels are matched that are outside
      of the known color bounds.

      Unless you need to do something advanced with color statistics just use the
      `Image.get_statistics()` method instead of this method for looking at pixel
      areas in an image.

      ``roi`` is the region-of-interest rectangle tuple (x, y, w, h). If not
      specified, it is equal to the image rectangle. Only pixels within the
      ``roi`` are operated on.

      ``bins`` and others are the number of bins to use for the histogram
      channels. For grayscale images use ``bins`` and for RGB565 images use
      the others for each channel. The bin counts must be greater than 2 for each
      channel. Additionally, it makes no sense to set the bin count larger than
      the number of unique pixel values for each channel. By default, the historgram
      will have the maximum number of bins per channel.

      ``difference`` may be set to an image object to cause this method to operate
      on the difference image between the current image and the ``difference`` image
      object. This saves having to use a separate buffer.

      Not supported on compressed images or bayer images.

   .. method:: get_statistics([thresholds, [invert=False, [roi, [bins, [l_bins, [a_bins, [b_bins, [difference]]]]]]]])

      Computes the mean, median, mode, standard deviation, min, max, lower
      quartile, and upper quartile for all color channels for an ``roi`` and
      returns a `image.statistics` object. Please see the `image.statistics`
      object for more information. You can also invoke this method by using
      ``Image.get_stats()`` or ``Image.statistics()``. If you pass a list of
      ``thresholds`` then the histogram information will only be computed from
      pixels within the threshold list.

      ``thresholds`` must be a list of tuples
      ``[(lo, hi), (lo, hi), ..., (lo, hi)]`` defining the ranges of color you
      want to track. For
      grayscale images each tuple needs to contain two values - a min grayscale
      value and a max grayscale value. Only pixel regions that fall between these
      thresholds will be considered. For RGB565 images each tuple needs to have
      six values (l_lo, l_hi, a_lo, a_hi, b_lo, b_hi) - which are minimums and
      maximums for the LAB L, A, and B channels respectively. For easy usage this
      function will automatically fix swapped min and max values. Additionally,
      if a tuple is larger than six values the rest are ignored. Conversely, if the
      tuple is too short the rest of the thresholds are assumed to be at maximum
      range.

      .. note::

         To get the thresholds for the object you want to track just select (click
         and drag) on the object you want to track in the IDE frame buffer. The
         histogram will then update to just be in that area. Then just write down
         where the color distribution starts and falls off in each histogram channel.

      ``invert`` inverts the thresholding operation such that instead of matching
      pixels inside of some known color bounds pixels are matched that are outside
      of the known color bounds.

      You'll want to use this method any time you need to get information about
      the values of an area of pixels in an image. For example, after if you're
      trying to detect motion using frame differencing you'll want to use this
      method to determine a change in the color channels of the image to trigger
      your motion detection threshold.

      ``roi`` is the region-of-interest rectangle tuple (x, y, w, h). If not
      specified, it is equal to the image rectangle. Only pixels within the
      ``roi`` are operated on.

      ``bins`` and others are the number of bins to use for the histogram
      channels. For grayscale images use ``bins`` and for RGB565 images use
      the others for each channel. The bin counts must be greater than 2 for each
      channel. Additionally, it makes no sense to set the bin count larger than
      the number of unique pixel values for each channel. By default, the historgram
      will have the maximum number of bins per channel.

      ``difference`` may be set to an image object to cause this method to operate
      on the difference image between the current image and the ``difference`` image
      object. This saves having to use a separate buffer.

      Not supported on compressed images or bayer images.

   .. method:: get_regression(thresholds, [invert=False, [roi, [x_stride=2, [y_stride=1, [area_threshold=10, [pixels_threshold=10, [robust=False]]]]]]])

      Computes a linear regression on all the thresholded pixels in the image. The
      linear regression is computed using least-squares normally which is fast but
      cannot handle any outliers. If ``robust`` is True then the Theil–Sen linear
      regression is used instead which computes the median of all slopes between
      all thresholded pixels in the image. This is an N^2 operation which may drops
      your FPS down to below 5 even on an 80x60 image if too many pixels are set
      after thresholding. However, as long as the number of pixels set after
      thresholding remains low the linear regression will be valid even in the case
      of up to 30% of the thresholded pixels being outliers (e.g. it's robust).

      This method returns a `image.line` object. See this blog post on how to use the
      line object easily: https://openmv.io/blogs/news/linear-regression-line-following

      ``thresholds`` must be a list of tuples
      ``[(lo, hi), (lo, hi), ..., (lo, hi)]`` defining the ranges of color you
      want to track. For
      grayscale images each tuple needs to contain two values - a min grayscale
      value and a max grayscale value. Only pixel regions that fall between these
      thresholds will be considered. For RGB565 images each tuple needs to have
      six values (l_lo, l_hi, a_lo, a_hi, b_lo, b_hi) - which are minimums and

      if a tuple is larger than six values the rest are ignored. Conversely, if the
      tuple is too short the rest of the thresholds are assumed to be at maximum
      range.

         and drag) on the object you want to track in the IDE frame buffer. The
         histogram will then update to just be in that area. Then just write down

         These will be your low and high values for ``thresholds``. It's best to
         manually determine the thresholds versus using the upper and lower
         quartile statistics because they are too tight.

         You may also determine color thresholds by going into
         ``Tools->Machine Vision->Threshold Editor`` in OpenMV IDE and selecting
         thresholds from the GUI slider window.

      ``invert`` inverts the thresholding operation such that instead of matching
      pixels inside of some known color bounds pixels are matched that are outside
      of the known color bounds.

      ``roi`` is the region-of-interest rectangle tuple (x, y, w, h). If not
      specified, it is equal to the image rectangle. Only pixels within the
      ``roi`` are operated on.

      ``x_stride`` is the number of x pixels to skip over when evaluating the image.

      ``y_stride`` is the number of y pixels to skip over when evaluating the image.

      If the regression's bounding box area is less than ``area_threshold`` then None is returned.

      If the regression's pixel count is less than ``pixels_threshold`` then None is returned.

      Not supported on compressed images or bayer images.

   .. method:: find_blobs(thresholds, [invert=False, [roi, [x_stride=2, [y_stride=1, [area_threshold=10, [pixels_threshold=10, [merge=False, [margin=0, [threshold_cb=None, [merge_cb=None, [x_hist_bins_max=0, [y_hist_bins_max=0]]]]]]]]]]]])

      Finds all blobs (connected pixel regions that pass a threshold test) in the
      image and returns a list of `image.blob` objects which describe each blob.
      Please see the `image.blob` object more more information.

      ``thresholds`` must be a list of tuples
      ``[(lo, hi), (lo, hi), ..., (lo, hi)]`` defining the ranges of color you
      want to track. You may pass up to 32 threshold tuples in one call. For
      grayscale images each tuple needs to contain two values - a min grayscale
      value and a max grayscale value. Only pixel regions that fall between these
      thresholds will be considered. For RGB565 images each tuple needs to have
      six values (l_lo, l_hi, a_lo, a_hi, b_lo, b_hi) - which are minimums and
      maximums for the LAB L, A, and B channels respectively. For easy usage this
      function will automatically fix swapped min and max values. Additionally,
      if a tuple is larger than six values the rest are ignored. Conversely, if the
      tuple is too short the rest of the thresholds are assumed to be at maximum
      range.

      .. note::

         To get the thresholds for the object you want to track just select (click
         and drag) on the object you want to track in the IDE frame buffer. The
         histogram will then update to just be in that area. Then just write down
         where the color distribution starts and falls off in each histogram channel.
         These will be your low and high values for ``thresholds``. It's best to
         manually determine the thresholds versus using the upper and lower
         quartile statistics because they are too tight.

         You may also determine color thresholds by going into
         ``Tools->Machine Vision->Threshold Editor`` in OpenMV IDE and selecting
         thresholds from the GUI slider window.

      ``invert`` inverts the thresholding operation such that instead of matching
      pixels inside of some known color bounds pixels are matched that are outside
      of the known color bounds.

      ``roi`` is the region-of-interest rectangle tuple (x, y, w, h). If not
      specified, it is equal to the image rectangle. Only pixels within the
      ``roi`` are operated on.

      ``x_stride`` is the number of x pixels to skip when searching for a blob.
      Once a blob is found the line fill algorithm will be pixel accurate.
      Increase ``x_stride`` to speed up finding blobs if blobs are known to be large.

      ``y_stride`` is the number of y pixels to skip when searching for a blob.
      Once a blob is found the line fill algorithm will be pixel accurate.
      Increase ``y_stride`` to speed up finding blobs if blobs are known to be large.

      If a blob's bounding box area is less than ``area_threshold`` it is filtered
      out.

      If a blob's pixel count is less than ``pixels_threshold`` it is filtered out.

      ``merge`` if True merges all not filtered out blobs whos bounding
      rectangles intersect each other. ``margin`` can be used to increase or
      decrease the size of the bounding rectangles for blobs during the
      intersection test. For example, with a margin of 1 blobs whos bounding
      rectangles are 1 pixel away from each other will be merged.

      Merging blobs allows you to implement color code tracking. Each blob object
      has a ``code`` value which is a bit vector made up of 1s for each color
      threshold. For example, if you pass `Image.find_blobs` two color
      thresholds then the first threshold has a code of 1 and the second 2 (a
      third threshold would be 4 and a fourth would be 8 and so on). Merged blobs
      logically OR all their codes together so that you know what colors produced
      them. This allows you to then track two colors if you get a blob object
      back with two colors then you know it might be a color code.

      You might also want to merge blobs if you are using tight color bounds which
      do not fully track all the pixels of an object you are trying to follow.

      Finally, if you want to merge blobs, but, don't want two color thresholds to
      be merged then just call `Image.find_blobs` twice with separate thresholds
      so that blobs aren't merged.

      ``threshold_cb`` may be set to the function to call on every blob after its
      been thresholded to filter it from the list of blobs to be merged. The call
      back function will receive one argument - the blob object to be filtered.
      The call back then must return True to keep the blob and False to filter it.

      ``merge_cb`` may be set to the function to call on every two blobs about to
      be merged to prevent or allow the merge. The call back function will receive
      two arguments - the two blob objects to be merged. The call back then must
      return True to merge the blobs or False to prevent merging the blobs.

      ``x_hist_bins_max`` if set to non-zero populates a histogram buffer in each
      blob object with an x_histogram projection of all columns in the object. This
      value then sets the number of bins for that projection.

      ``y_hist_bins_max`` if set to non-zero populates a histogram buffer in each
      blob object with an y_histogram projection of all rows in the object. This
      value then sets the number of bins for that projection.

      Not supported on compressed images or bayer images.

   .. method:: find_lines([roi, [x_stride=2, [y_stride=1, [threshold=1000, [theta_margin=25, [rho_margin=25]]]]]])

      Finds all infinite lines in the image using the hough transform. Returns a list
      of `image.line` objects.

      ``roi`` is the region-of-interest rectangle tuple (x, y, w, h). If not
      specified, it is equal to the image rectangle. Only pixels within the
      ``roi`` are operated on.

      ``x_stride`` is the number of x pixels to skip when doing the hough transform.
      Only increase this if lines you are searching for are large and bulky.

      ``y_stride`` is the number of y pixels to skip when doing the hough transform.
      Only increase this if lines you are searching for are large and bulky.

      ``threshold`` controls what lines are detected from the hough transform. Only
      lines with a magnitude greater than or equal to ``threshold`` are returned. The
      right value of ``threshold`` for your application is image dependent. Note that
      the magnitude of a line is the sum of all sobel filter magnitudes of pixels
      that make up that line.

      ``theta_margin`` controls the merging of detected lines. Lines which are
      ``theta_margin`` degrees apart and ``rho_margin`` rho apart are merged.

      ``rho_margin`` controls the merging of detected lines. Lines which are
      ``theta_margin`` degrees apart and ``rho_margin`` rho apart are merged.

      This method working by running the sobel filter over the image and taking
      the magnitude and gradient responses from the sobel filter to feed a hough
      transform. It does not require any preprocessing on the image first. However,
      my cleaning up the image using filtering you may get more stable results.

      Not supported on compressed images or bayer images.

      This method is not available on the OpenMV Cam M4.

   .. method:: find_line_segments([roi, [merge_distance=0, [max_theta_difference=15]]])

      Finds line segments in the image using the hough transform. Returns a list
      of `image.line` objects .

      ``roi`` is the region-of-interest rectangle tuple (x, y, w, h). If not
      specified, it is equal to the image rectangle. Only pixels within the
      ``roi`` are operated on.

      ``merge_distance`` specifies the maximum number of pixels two line segements
      can be seperated by each other (at any point on one line) to be merged.

      ``max_theta_difference`` is the maximum theta difference in degrees two line
      segements that are ``merge_distance`` apart to be merged.

      This method uses the LSD library (also used by OpenCV) to find line segements
      in the image. It's somewhat slow but very accurate and lines don't jump around.

      This method is not available on the OpenMV Cam M4.

   .. method:: find_circles([roi, [x_stride=2, [y_stride=1, [threshold=2000, [x_margin=10, [y_margin=10, [r_margin=10, [r_min=2, [r_max, [r_step=2]]]]]]]]]])

      Finds circles in the image using the hough transform. Returns a list of
      `image.circle` objects.

      ``roi`` is the region-of-interest rectangle tuple (x, y, w, h). If not
      specified, it is equal to the image rectangle. Only pixels within the
      ``roi`` are operated on.

      ``x_stride`` is the number of x pixels to skip when doing the hough transform.
      Only increase this if circles you are searching for are large and bulky.

      ``y_stride`` is the number of y pixels to skip when doing the hough transform.
      Only increase this if circles you are searching for are large and bulky.

      ``threshold`` controls what circles are detected from the hough transform. Only
      circles with a magnitude greater than or equal to ``threshold`` are returned. The
      right value of ``threshold`` for your application is image dependent. Note that
      the magnitude of a circle is the sum of all sobel filter magnitudes of pixels
      that make up that circle.

      ``x_margin`` controls the merging of detected circles. Circles which are
      ``x_margin``, ``y_margin``, and ``r_margin`` pixels apart are merged.

      ``y_margin`` controls the merging of detected circles. Circles which are
      ``x_margin``, ``y_margin``, and ``r_margin`` pixels apart are merged.

      ``r_margin`` controls the merging of detected circles. Circles which are
      ``x_margin``, ``y_margin``, and ``r_margin`` pixels apart are merged.

      ``r_min`` controls the minimum circle radius detected. Increase this to speed
      up the algorithm. Defaults to 2.

      ``r_max`` controls the maximum circle radius detected. Decrease this to speed
      up the algorithm. Defaults to min(roi.w/2, roi.h/2).

   .. method:: find_rects([roi=Auto, [threshold=10000]])

      Find rectangles in the image using the same quad detection algorithm used to
      find apriltags. Works best of rectangles that have good contrast against the
      background. The apriltag quad detection algorithm can handle any
      scale/rotation/shear on rectangles. Returns a list of `image.rect` objects.

      ``roi`` is the region-of-interest rectangle tuple (x, y, w, h). If not
      specified, it is equal to the image rectangle. Only pixels within the
      ``roi`` are operated on.

      Rectangles which have an edge magnitude (which is computed by sliding the
      sobel operator across all pixels on the edges of the rectangle and summing
      their values) less than ``threshold`` are filtered out of the returned list.
      The correct value of ``threshold`` is depended on your application/scene.

      This method is not available on the OpenMV Cam M4.

   .. method:: find_qrcodes([roi])

      Finds all qrcodes within the ``roi`` and returns a list of `image.qrcode`
      objects. Please see the `image.qrcode` object for more information.

      QR Codes need to be relatively flat in the image for this method to work.
      You can achieve a flatter image that is not effected by lens distortion by
      either using the `sensor.set_windowing()` function to zoom in the on the
      center of the lens, `Image.lens_corr()` to undo lens barrel distortion, or
      by just changing out the lens for something with a narrower fields of view.
      There are machine vision lenses available which do not cause barrel
      distortion but they are much more expensive to than the standard lenses
      supplied by OpenMV.

      ``roi`` is the region-of-interest rectangle tuple (x, y, w, h). If not
      specified, it is equal to the image rectangle. Only pixels within the
      ``roi`` are operated on.

      This method is not available on the OpenMV Cam M4.

   .. method:: find_apriltags([roi, [families=image.TAG36H11, [fx, [fy, [cx, [cy]]]]]])

      Finds all apriltags within the ``roi`` and returns a list of `image.apriltag`
      objects. Please see the `image.apriltag` object for more information.

      Unlike QR Codes, AprilTags can be detected at much farther distances, worse
      lighting, in warped images, etc. AprilTags are robust too all kinds of
      image distortion issues that QR Codes are not to. That said, AprilTags
      can only encode a numeric ID as their payload.

      AprilTags can also be used for localization purposes. Each `image.apriltag`
      object returns its translation and rotation from the camera. The units
      of the translation are determined by ``fx``, ``fy``, ``cx``, and ``cy``
      which are the focal lengths and center points of the image in the X and
      Y directions respectively.

      .. note::

         To create AprilTags use the tag generator tool built-in to OpenMV IDE.
         The tag generator can create printable 8.5"x11" AprilTags.

      ``roi`` is the region-of-interest rectangle tuple (x, y, w, h). If not
      specified, it is equal to the image rectangle. Only pixels within the
      ``roi`` are operated on.

      ``families`` is bitmask of tag families to decode. It is the logical OR of:

        * `image.TAG16H5`
        * `image.TAG25H7`
        * `image.TAG25H9`
        * `image.TAG36H10`
        * `image.TAG36H11`
        * `image.ARTOOLKIT`

      By default it is just `image.TAG36H11` which is the best tag family to
      use. Note that `Image.find_apriltags()` slows down per enabled tag family.

      ``fx`` is the camera X focal length in pixels. For the standard OpenMV Cam
      this is (2.8 / 3.984) * 656. Which is the lens focal length in mm, divided
      by the camera sensor length in the X direction multiplied by the number of
      camera sensor pixels in the X direction (for the OV7725 camera).

      ``fx`` is the camera Y focal length in pixels. For the standard OpenMV Cam
      this is (2.8 / 2.952) * 488. Which is the lens focal length in mm, divided
      by the camera sensor length in the Y direction multiplied by the number of
      camera sensor pixels in the Y direction (for the OV7725 camera).

      ``cx`` is the image center which is just ``image.width()/2``. This is not
      ``roi.w()/2``.

      ``cy`` is the image center which is just ``image.height()/2``. This is not
      ``roi.h()/2``.

      Not supported on compressed images.

      This method is not available on the OpenMV Cam M4.

   .. method:: find_datamatrices([roi, [effort=200]])

      Finds all datamatrices within the ``roi`` and returns a list of `image.datamatrix`
      objects. Please see the `image.datamatrix` object for more information.

      Data Matrices need to be relatively flat in the image for this method to work.
      You can achieve a flatter image that is not effected by lens distortion by
      either using the `sensor.set_windowing()` function to zoom in the on the
      center of the lens, `Image.lens_corr()` to undo lens barrel distortion, or
      by just changing out the lens for something with a narrower fields of view.
      There are machine vision lenses available which do not cause barrel
      distortion but they are much more expensive to than the standard lenses
      supplied by OpenMV.

      ``roi`` is the region-of-interest rectangle tuple (x, y, w, h). If not
      specified, it is equal to the image rectangle. Only pixels within the
      ``roi`` are operated on.

      ``effort`` controls how much time to spend trying to find data matrix matches.
      The default value of 200 should be good for all use-cases. However, you may
      increase the effort, at a cost of the frame rate, to increase detection. You
      may also lower the effort to increase the frame rate, but, at a cost of
      detections... note that when ``effort`` is set to below 160 or so you will
      not detect anything anymore. Also note that you can make ``effort`` as high
      as you like. But, any values above 240 or so do not result in much increase
      in the detection rate.

      This method is not available on the OpenMV Cam M4.

   .. method:: find_barcodes([roi])

      Finds all 1D barcodes within the ``roi`` and returns a list of `image.barcode`
      objects. Please see the `image.barcode` object for more information.

      For best results use a 640 by 40/80/160 window. The lower the vertical res
      the faster everything will run. Since bar codes are linear 1D images you
      just need a lot of resolution in one direction and just a little resolution
      in the other direction. Note that this function scans both horizontally and
      vertically so you can use a 40/80/160 by 480 window if you want. Finally,
      make sure to adjust your lens so that the bar code is positioned where the
      focal length produces the sharpest image. Blurry bar codes can't be decoded.

      This function supports all these 1D barcodes (basically all barcodes):

        * `image.EAN2`
        * `image.EAN5`
        * `image.EAN8`
        * `image.UPCE`
        * `image.ISBN10`
        * `image.UPCA`
        * `image.EAN13`
        * `image.ISBN13`
        * `image.I25`
        * `image.DATABAR` (RSS-14)
        * `image.DATABAR_EXP` (RSS-Expanded)
        * `image.CODABAR`
        * `image.CODE39`
        * `image.PDF417`
        * `image.CODE93`
        * `image.CODE128`

      ``roi`` is the region-of-interest rectangle tuple (x, y, w, h). If not
      specified, it is equal to the image rectangle. Only pixels within the
      ``roi`` are operated on.

      This method is not available on the OpenMV Cam M4.

   .. method:: find_displacement(template, [roi, [template_roi, [logpolar=False]]])

      Find the translation offset of the this image from the template. This
      method can be used to do optical flow. This method returns a `image.displacement`
      object with the results of the displacement calculation using phase correlation.

      ``roi`` is the region-of-interest rectangle (x, y, w, h) to work in.
      If not specified, it is equal to the image rectangle.

      ``template_roi`` is the region-of-interest rectangle (x, y, w, h) to work in.
      If not specified, it is equal to the image rectangle.

      ``roi`` and ``template`` roi must have the same w/h but may have any x/y
      location in the image. You may slide smaller rois arround a larger image to
      get an optical flow gradient image...

      `Image.find_displacement()` normally computes the x/y translation between two
      images. However, if you pass ``logpolar=True`` it will instead find rotation
      and scale changes between the two images. The same `image.displacement` object
      result encodes both possible repsonses.

      Not supported on compressed images or bayer images.

      .. note::

         Please use this method on power-of-2 image sizes (e.g. `sensor.B64X64`).

      Not supported on compressed images or bayer images.

      This method is not available on the OpenMV Cam M4.

   .. method:: find_template(template, threshold, [roi, [step=2, [search=image.SEARCH_EX]]])

      Tries to find the first location in the image where template matches using
      Normalized Cross Correlation. Returns a bounding box tuple (x, y, w, h) for
      the matching location otherwise None.

      ``template`` is a small image object that is matched against this image
      object. Note that both images must be grayscale.

      ``threshold`` is floating point number (0.0-1.0) where a higher threshold
      prevents false positives while lowering the detection rate while a lower
      threshold does the opposite.

      ``roi`` is the region-of-interest rectangle tuple (x, y, w, h). If not
      specified, it is equal to the image rectangle. Only pixels within the
      ``roi`` are operated on.

      ``step`` is the number of pixels to skip past while looking for the
      template. Skipping pixels considerably speeds the algorithm up. This only
      affects the algorithm in SERACH_EX mode.

      ``search`` can be either ``image.SEARCH_DS`` or ``image.SEARCH_EX``.
      ``image.SEARCH_DS`` searches for the template using as faster algorithm
      than ``image.SEARCH_EX`` but may not find the template if it's near the
      edges of the image. ``image.SEARCH_EX`` does an exhaustive search for the
      image but can be much slower than ``image.SEARCH_DS``.

      Only works on grayscale images.

   .. method:: find_features(cascade, [threshold=0.5, [scale=1.5, [roi]]])

      This method searches the image for all areas that match the passed in Haar
      Cascade and returns a list of bounding box rectangles tuples (x, y, w, h)
      around those features. Returns an empty list if no features are found.

      ``cascade`` is a Haar Cascade object. See `image.HaarCascade()` for more
      details.

      ``threshold`` is a threshold (0.0-1.0) where a smaller value increase the
      detection rate while raising the false positive rate. Conversely, a higher
      value decreases the detection rate while lowering the false positive rate.

      ``scale`` is a float that must be greater than 1.0. A higher scale
      factor will run faster but will have much poorer image matches. A good
      value is between 1.35 and 1.5.

      ``roi`` is the region-of-interest rectangle tuple (x, y, w, h). If not
      specified, it is equal to the image rectangle. Only pixels within the
      ``roi`` are operated on.

   .. method:: find_eye(roi)

      Searches for the pupil in a region-of-interest (x, y, w, h) tuple around an
      eye. Returns a tuple with the (x, y) location of the pupil in the image.
      Returns (0,0) if no pupils are found.

      To use this function first use `Image.find_features()` with the
      ``frontalface`` HaarCascade to find someone's face. Then use
      `Image.find_features()` with the ``eye`` HaarCascade to find the eyes on the
      face. Finally, call this method on the eye ROI returned by
      `Image.find_features()` to get the pupil coordinates.

      ``roi`` is the region-of-interest rectangle tuple (x, y, w, h). If not
      specified, it is equal to the image rectangle. Only pixels within the
      ``roi`` are operated on.

      Only works on grayscale images.

   .. method:: find_lbp(roi)

      Extracts LBP (local-binary-patterns) keypoints from the region-of-interest
      (x, y, w, h) tuple. You can then use then use the `image.match_descriptor()`
      function to compare two sets of keypoints to get the matching distance.

      ``roi`` is the region-of-interest rectangle tuple (x, y, w, h). If not
      specified, it is equal to the image rectangle. Only pixels within the
      ``roi`` are operated on.

      Only works on grayscale images.

   .. method:: find_keypoints([roi, [threshold=20, [normalized=False, [scale_factor=1.5, [max_keypoints=100, [corner_detector=image.CORNER_AGAST]]]]]])

      Extracts ORB keypoints from the region-of-interest (x, y, w, h) tuple. You
      can then use then use the `image.match_descriptor()` function to compare
      two sets of keypoints to get the matching areas. Returns None if no
      keypoints were found.

      ``roi`` is the region-of-interest rectangle tuple (x, y, w, h). If not
      specified, it is equal to the image rectangle. Only pixels within the
      ``roi`` are operated on.

      ``threshold`` is a number (between 0 - 255) which controls the number of
      extracted corners. For the default AGAST corner detector this should be
      around 20. FOr the FAST corner detector this should be around 60-80. The
      lower the threshold the more extracted corners you get.

      ``normalized`` is a boolean value that if True turns off extracting
      keypoints at multiple resolutions. Set this to true if you don't care
      about dealing with scaling issues and want the algorithm to run faster.

      ``scale_factor`` is a float that must be greater than 1.0. A higher scale
      factor will run faster but will have much poorer image matches. A good
      value is between 1.35 and 1.5.

      ``max_keypoints`` is the maximum number of keypoints a keypoint object may
      hold. If keypoint objects are too big and causing out of RAM issues then
      decrease this value.

      ``corner_detector`` is the corner detector algorithm to use which extracts
      keypoints from the image. It can be either `image.CORNER_FAST` or
      `image.CORNER_AGAST`. The FAST corner detector is faster but much less accurate.

      Only works on grayscale images.

   .. method:: find_edges(edge_type, [threshold])

      Turns the image to black and white leaving only the edges as white pixels.

         * image.EDGE_SIMPLE - Simple thresholded high pass filter algorithm.
         * image.EDGE_CANNY - Canny edge detection algorithm.

      ``threshold`` is a two valued tuple containing a low threshold and high
      threshold. You can control the quality of edges by adjusting these values.
      It defaults to (100, 200).

      Only works on grayscale images.

   .. method:: find_hog([roi, [size=8]])

      Replaces the pixels in the ROI with HOG (histogram of orientated graidients)
      lines.

      ``roi`` is the region-of-interest rectangle tuple (x, y, w, h). If not
      specified, it is equal to the image rectangle. Only pixels within the
      ``roi`` are operated on.

      Only works on grayscale images.

      This method is not available on the OpenMV Cam M4.

   .. method:: stero_disparity([reversed=False, [max_disparity=64, [threshold=64]]])

      Takes a double wide grayscale image that contains the output of two camera sensors
      side-by-side and replaces one of the images int he double wide image with the stero-disparity
      image where each pixel reprsents depth. E.g. if you have two 320x240 cameras then this method
      takes a 640x240 image.

      ``reversed`` By default the left image is compared to the right image and the right image
      is then replaced. Pass true to compare the right image to the left image and replace the left
      image.

      .. note::

         The algorithm only works comparing left->right or right->left. If your camrea setup does
         not match this then you will get useless results.

      ``max_disparity`` is the maximum distance to search for a matching pixel block using the
      sum-of-absolute differences algorith. Larger values take exponentially longer to search with
      but result in higher quality images. Lower values make the algorithm run faster but may
      result in nonsense output.

      ``threshold`` if the sum-of-absolute differences between two blocks is less than or equal
      to this threshold they are considered to be matching.

      This method is only available on the Arduino Portenta.

      .. note::

         Even with our best SIMD effort this algorithm is not real-time on the Cortex-M7 processor.
         This is just a toy example algorithm showing off stero-disparity.

Constants
---------

.. data:: BINARY

   BINARY (bitmap) pixel format. Each pixel is 1-bit.

.. data:: GRAYSCALE

   GRAYSCALE pixel format. Each pixel is 8-bits, 1-byte.

.. data:: RGB565

   RGB565 pixel format. Each pixel is 16-bits, 2-bytes. 5-bits are used for red,
   6-bits are used for green, and 5-bits are used for blue.

.. data:: BAYER

   RAW BAYER image pixel format. If you try to make the frame size too big
   to fit in the frame buffer your OpenMV Cam will set the pixel format
   to BAYER so that you can capture images but no image processing methods
   will be operational.

.. data:: YUV422

   A pixel format that is very easy to jpeg compress. Each pixel is stored as a grayscale
   8-bit Y value followed by alternating 8-bit U/V color values that are shared between two
   Y values (8-bits Y1, 8-bits U, 8-bits Y2, 8-bits V, etc.). Only some image processing
   methods work with YUV422.

.. data:: BILINEAR

   Use bilinear scaling when upscaling an image. This produces a good quality scaled image output
   and is fast.

   When downscaling an image this method will subsample the input image to produce the downscaled
   image. Use `image.AREA` for the higest quality downscaling if speed is not an issue.
