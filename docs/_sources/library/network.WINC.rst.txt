class WINC -- wifi shield driver
================================

The ``WINC`` class is used for controlling the wifi shield.

Example usage::

    import network

    wlan = network.WINC()
    wlan.connect("SSID", "KEY")

    wlan.ifconfig()

Constructors
------------

.. class:: WINC([mode=MODE_STATION])

   Creates a winc driver object and connects to the wifi shield which uses
   I/O pins P0, P1, P2, P3, P6, P7, and P8.

   ``mode`` controls the mode the WINC module works in:

     * network.WINC.MODE_STATION

       The module connects to an access point as a client. This is the default mode.

     * network.WINC.MODE_AP

       The module will create an AP (Access Point) and accept connections from a client.

       .. note::

          The start_ap() method must be called after setting AP mode to configure the AP.

          Also, the WINC1500 has some limitations in its AP implementation:

             * Only one client can connect at a time.
             * Only OPEN or WEP security are supported.
             * There's a bug in the WiFi Module FW, when the client disconnects any bound sockets are lost (they just stop working). As a workaround, set a timeout for the server socket to force it to raise an exception and then reopen it (See the example script).

     * network.WINC.MODE_FIRMWARE:

       This mode enables WiFi module firmware update.

   .. note::

      ``mode`` can also be ``network.STA_IF`` (station aka client, connects to upstream WiFi access
      points) and and ``network.AP_IF`` (access point, allows other WiFi clients to
      connect). Availability of the methods below depends on interface type.
      For example, only STA interface may `WLAN.connect()` to an access point.

   Methods
   -------

   .. method:: active([is_active])

      Activate ("up") or deactivate ("down") network interface, if boolean
      argument is passed. Otherwise, query current state if no argument is
      provided. Most other methods require active interface.

   .. method:: connect(ssid, [key=None, [security=WPA_PSK, [channel=1]]])

      Connect to a wifi network with ssid ``ssid`` using key ``key`` with
      security ``security`` and channel ``channel``.

      After connecting to the network use the :mod:`usocket` module to open TCP/UDP
      ports to send and receive data.

      .. note::

         This method takes a little while to return.

   .. method:: start_ap(ssid, [key=None, [security=OPEN, [channel=1]]])

      When running in AP mode this method must be called after creating
      a WINC object to configure and start the AP .

      * ssid: The AP SSID (must be set).
      * key: The AP encryption key. A Key is required only if security is WEP.
      * security: AP security mode (only OPEN or WEP are supported).
      * channel: WiFi channel, change this if you have another AP running at the same channel.

   .. method:: disconnect()

      Disconnect from the wifi network.

   .. method:: isconnected()

      Returns True if connected to an access point and an IP address has been
      obtained.

   .. method:: connected_sta()

      This method returns a list containing the connected client's IP adress.

   .. method:: wait_for_sta(timeout)

      This method blocks and waits for a client to connect. If timeout is 0
      this will block forever. This method returns a list containing the
      connected client's IP adress.

   .. method:: ifconfig([ip_addr, subnet_addr, gateway_addr, dns_addr])

      Returns a tuple containing:

         * [0]: IP Address String (XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX)
         * [1]: Subnet Address String (XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX)
         * [2]: Gateway String (XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX)
         * [3]: DNS Address String (XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX)

      While connected to the network.

      You may optionally pass a tuple/list of the ip_addr, subnet_addr,
      gateway_addr, and dns_addr strings in ipv4 (XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX) format
      to set a static IP address versus an address obtained through DHCP (which happens by default).

      Example usage::

         wlan = network.WINC()
         wlan.ifconfig(('192.168.1.100', '255.255.255.0', '192.168.1.1', '192.168.1.1'))
         wlan.connect(SSID, key=KEY, security=wlan.WPA_PSK)

   .. method:: netinfo()

      Returns a tuple containing:

         * [0]: RSSI - received signal strength indicator (int)
         * [1]: Authorization Type (see constants)
         * [2]: Set Service Identifier String (SSID)
         * [3]: MAC Address String (XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX) (BSSID)
         * [4]: IP Address String (XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX)

      While connected to the network.

   .. method:: scan()

      Returns a list containing:

         * [0]: Set Service Identifier String (SSID)
         * [1]: MAC Address String (XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX) (BSSID)
         * [2]: Channel Number (int)
         * [3]: RSSI - received signal strength indicator (int)
         * [4]: Authorization Type (see constants)
         * [5]: 1 (int)

      You don't need to be connected to call this.

   .. method:: rssi()

      Returns the received signal strength indicator (int) of the currently
      connected network.

   .. method:: fw_version()

      Returns a tuple containing the wifi shield firmware version number.

         * [0]: Firmware Major Version Number (int)
         * [1]: Firmware Minor Version Number (int)
         * [2]: Firmware Patch Version Number (int)
         * [3]: Driver Major Version Number (int)
         * [4]: Driver Minor Version Number (int)
         * [5]: Driver Patch Version Number (int)
         * [6]: Hardware Revision Number - Chip ID (int)

   .. method:: fw_dump(path)

      Dumps the wifi shield firmware to a binary file at ``path``. You must
      have put the module into firmware mode to use this.

   .. method:: fw_update(path)

      Programs the wifi shield with binary image found at ``path``. You must
      have put the module into firmware mode to use this.
